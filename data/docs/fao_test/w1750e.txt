<title>PROCESS FOR THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE INDIAN OCEAN TUNA COMMISSION</title>
<section>1</section>
INTRODUCTION
1. The long-term institutional arrangements for the management of tuna in the Indian Ocean has been discussed by the Indian Ocean Fishery Commission (IOFC) since its First Session in 1968 and in the IOFC Committee for the Management of Indian Ocean Tuna since 1970. The substantial increase in the catch of tuna and tuna-like species in the 1980s prompted serious discussions at the Ninth Session of the IOFC Committee for the Management of Indian Ocean Tuna in 1986. This marked the beginning of a serious attempt towards establishing a commission with appropriate structure and power to manage the tunas of the Indian Ocean. The Committee set up a small ad hoc group of nations to review in detail the options available for the long-term institutional arrangements for the management of tuna in the Indian Ocean.
2. The First Government Consultation, held in Rome in May 1987, had an exploratory mission. It discussed in rather general terms the issues related to the institutional arrangements for the management of tuna in the Indian Ocean. A Second Government Consultation held in Bangkok, Thailand, in March 1988 made substantial progress in identifying the issues which were contentious and needed elaboration. Following formal and informal discussions and negotiations, the First Conference for the Adoption of a Draft Agreement for the Establishment of the India Ocean Tuna Commission under Article XIV of FAO Constitution was held in Rome in 1989. The Conference considered that further amendments to the text were needed in order to improve the Draft Agreement. The outstanding issues at this stage were the membership (in view of the interest of the European Community), funding and the powers of the Commission.
3. In 1991, the Basic Texts of FAO were amended, paving the way for the European Community (EC) to become a member of the Organization, as well as granting more power to bodies established under Article XIV of the FAO Constitution. The Second Conference whi94ch was held in Rome in June 1992 reached broad agreement on the Text of the Draft Agreement. The Draft Agreement for the Establishment of the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission was finally adopted by the FAO Council in 1993 and circulated in 1994. It entered into force in 1996. The present document describes the origin and the long process by which the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission (IOTC) was established.

I. CONSERVATION AND MANAGEMENT OF TUNA IN THE INDIAN OCEAN
I.1 The Establishment of the Indian Ocean Fishery Commission (IOFC), 1967
4. The Indian Ocean Fishery Commission (IOFC) was established by Resolution 2/48 of the FAO Council at its Forty-eighth Session in September 1967. The Council in setting up the Commission noted that "the Indian Ocean is an area as yet inadequately served by international fishery bodies" and that "the need for collective action for the development and rational utilization of the fishery resources of the area had been established". The mandate of the Commission is:
(a) To promote, assist and coordinate national programmes over the entire field of fishery development and conservation;
(b) to promote research and development activities in the area through international sources, in particular through international aid programmes;
(c) to examine management problems, with special emphasis on the management of offshore resources.
5. Its area of competence is the Indian Ocean and adjacent seas excluding the Antarctic area. The species covered by the Commission are all living marine resources. Its membership is open to all Member Nations and Associate Members of FAO. At its First Session held in Rome in September 1968, the Commission reviewed the state of knowledge of the inshore, offshore and oceanic fisheries of the Indian Ocean as well as the status of fishery statistics in the region. The Commission decided that the improvement of fishery statistics for the region was a matter of fundamental priority. It also agreed that high priority should be given to the management of heavily exploited stocks.
I.2 IOFC Committee for the Management of Indian Ocean Tuna, 1968
6. At its First Session, the Commission established the Committee for the Management of Indian Ocean Tuna the membership of which consisted of Australia, India, Indonesia, Japan, Korea (Republic of), Sri Lanka, Tanzania and USA. The Committee for the Management of Indian Ocean Tuna was given the following mandate:
"To assist IOFC in its consideration of the steps required to introduce management measures for heavily exploited stocks of tuna when these measures are found necessary".
The Committee held its First Session in Rome, in October 1970.
7. In November of that year, the Indo-Pacific Fishery Commission (IPFC) (Fourteenth Session, 18-27 November 1970, Bangkok, Thailand), now Asia-Pacific Fishery Commission (APFIC) , also decided to establish the IPFC Special Committee on Management of Indo-Pacific Tuna. From 1971 to 1980 the two Committees held six Joint Sessions as follows:
1st joint meeting of the Committees: 22-23 April 1971, Rome, Italy
2nd joint meeting of the Committees: 5-6 October 1972, Colombo, Sri Lanka
3rd joint meeting of the Committees: 18-19 July 1975, Mombasa, Kenya
4th joint meeting of the Committees: 29-30 October 1976, Colombo, Sri Lanka
5th joint meeting of the Committees: 3-4 March 1978, Manila, Philippines
6th joint meeting of the Committees: 21-22 February 1980, Perth, Australia
At its Twenty-first Session in 1984, the IPFC decided that in view of the scientific information concerning the low degree of interaction between the Indian Ocean and Pacific Tuna stocks, it was unnecessary to continue the practice of convening joint meetings.
8. During this period, the review and assessment of the state of tuna in the areas covered by the two Committees were based mainly on the reports of the IOFC/IPFC Ad hoc Working Party of Scientists on Stock Assessment of Tuna, reports of several expert consultations and workshops on various aspects relating to tuna and the ad hoc meetings and reports by some members on their tuna activities. By 1980, the IOFC Committee for the Management of Indian Ocean Tuna had acquired substantial information on the state of tuna and the trends of tuna fisheries in the region. Apart from monitoring tuna fishing activities and reviewing the state of tuna, the Committees did not recommend any specific management measures although they repeatedly emphasized that the longline fishery should be reduced in the Indian Ocean. The question of management of tuna and some form of proper arrangements was never off the agenda of the Committees.
9. At its Sixth Session (Perth, Australia, 1980), IOFC made the membership of the Committee open-ended so that any member of the Commission could become a member of the Committee. The terms of reference of the Committee were also revised at this Session:
(i) to review the state of the stocks of tuna, particularly in relation to the level of exploitation and likely development;
(ii) to consider the boundaries of the area that have to be taken into account in any management of tuna, bearing in mind particularly the movement of fish and fishing vessels;
(iii) to review measures that might be considered for the planning, management and development of the tuna fisheries and to suggest the administrative and other actions that would be required to put such measures into effect; and
(iv) to consider arrangements for ensuring the continuation and coordination of the necessary research and the continuing re-assessment of the state of the stocks.
The Committee did not resume its regular sessions until 1985. By then the Indo-Pacific Tuna Development and Management Programme which had become operational early in 1982 was in a position to provide information to and receive guidance from the Committee on most technical and scientific aspects related to Indian Ocean tuna.
I.3 Recent Trends in Tuna Fisheries in the Indian Ocean
10. Until the beginning of the 1980s, there was a gradual but steady increase in the catches of tuna and tuna-like species in the Indian Ocean. The fisheries consisted of small-scale or artisanal fisheries by coastal countries in the region as well as industrial fisheries from Japan, the Republic of Korea and Taiwan (Province of China). Following the establishment of the 200 nautical miles Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZ) most of the fisheries resources fell within the exclusive jurisdiction of coastal States. In order to have access to these resources many industrial fishing nations concluded fisheries agreements with coastal States, allowing them to fish in their EEZs. This was particularly significant in the case of tuna fisheries in the Indian Ocean. In the early eighties, following the conclusion of a number of bilateral fisheries agreements between the EC and the coastal countries in the region, the EC tuna fleet moved to the western part of the Indian Ocean in
substantial
numbers. Port Victoria in Seychelles became, and still remains, the most important port for transhipment in the Western Indian Ocean.
11. The total catch of tuna and tuna-like species in the Indian Ocean rose steadily from around 150 000 t in the early 1960s to 238 616 t in 1975. They continued to rise from 306 905 t in 1980 to 566 231 in 1985 and again to 981 319 t in 1993 (see figure 1). The landings from the Western Indian Ocean (FAO Statistical Area 51) increased from 261 168 t in 1983 to 429 434 t in 1985 and again to 782 104 t in 1993.
12. Yellowfin and skipjack are the main two species targeted by distant-water fishing nations (DWFNs). In 1975 the total catch of yellowfin in the Indian Ocean was 28 390 t rising steadily to 34 064 t in 1980 and to 103 924 t in 1985, and increasing substantially to 349 935 t in 1993. During the same period, the total catch of skipjack rose from 35 165 t in 1975 to 45 835 t in 1980, to 141 475 t in 1985 and to 250 460 t in 1993 (see figure 2).
I.4 Indo-Pacific Tuna Development and Management Programme (IPTP)
13. In the latter part of the seventies the need for coordination and implementation of tuna fishery development as well as management and investigation activities in the Indian and Pacific Oceans had been discussed by both IPFC and IOFC. At the Sixth Joint Meeting of the IOFC and IPFC Tuna Management Committees in 1980, it was recommended that funding should be sought to initiate such a broad coordination and implementation programme.
14. The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) tuna project, based in Manila, Philippines, which ended in 1981 provided a professional officer and a consultant to begin investigation of data availability and quality in the coastal and island nations of the area and to review the need for a broad-based development and management programme. The preparatory assistance phase of project INT/81/034 recruited a Programme Director and Statistician and provided the necessary equipment to establish a permanent headquarters for the project in Colombo, Sri Lanka in early 1982. These activities led to the UNDP funding of an Indo-Pacific Tuna Development and Management Programme which ended in June 1984 and then periodically extended. Since 1990 funding has come entirely from a cost sharing arrangement between participating countries and the EC under the UNDP Programme. The main objective of IPTP has been to establish a tuna data centre as a basis for the management and development
of tuna fisheries in the region.
15. To complement the IPTP, FAO established a Trust Fund in 1980. A Five-Year Project, "Investigation on Indian Ocean and Western Pacific Small Tuna Resources (GCP/RAS/099/JPN)", was developed and Japanese funding was secured. Since then the project has been funded by Japan and other donors as well as participating countries.

16. Since it became operational, IPTP has contributed substantially to the work of the IOFC Committee for the Management of Indian Ocean Tuna which resumed its regular sessions in 1985. Until the last session of the Committee, which was held in 1990, IPTP acted as its scientific body undertaking various activities during intersessional periods and organizing expert consultations on Indian Ocean tunas prior to the Committee's meetings. The Expert Consultations have been held regularly, the latest of which was held in Colombo, Sri Lanka, in September 1995.

II. DISCUSSIONS AND PROGRESS ON POSSIBLE OPTIONS FOR THE ESTABLISHMENT OF AN INDIAN OCEAN TUNA MANAGEMENT BODY BY IOFC AND THE IOFC COMMITTEE FOR THE MANAGEMENT OF INDIAN OCEAN TUNA
II.1 Background
17. Detailed discussions on the institutional arrangements that would be most suitable for the formulation, adoption and implementation of management measures took place at the First Session of the IOFC Committee for the Management of Indian Ocean Tuna in 1970, at the Second Session of IOFC in October 1970, at the First and Second Joint meetings of the IOFC and IPFC Tuna Committees in 1971 and 1972 respectively, and at the Third Session of IOFC in 1973. The views expressed on the occasion of these meetings may be summarized as follows:
(i) Two delegations were of the opinion that it was necessary to create a new body similar to the Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission (I-ATTC) and the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT). It was essential that all countries concerned with tuna fisheries should become full members of the management body. This would be possible in the case of an independent body, while certain of the countries concerned were not Member Nations of FAO and therefore could not become members of IOFC. They also stated that it was not the role of FAO and of its subsidiary bodies to concern themselves directly with the adoption and implementation of management measures.
(ii) One delegation felt that interim and temporary measures could be discussed and recommended by existing bodies and that FAO should be requested to take steps to convene a conference of plenipotentiaries that might adopt a convention providing for the establishment of an independent tuna management body.
(iii) The other delegations were of the opinion that the unnecessary proliferation of management bodies should be avoided. As IOFC and IPFC had been entrusted with the task of examining management problems, they constituted the most appropriate forum to discuss and recommend management measures. As bodies established within the framework of FAO, IOFC and IPFC were well equipped to fulfil the Organization's role to ensure that fishery resources were utilized for the maximum benefit of the international community and that development and management would be considered as complementary aspects of the single aim of rational utilization of the tuna resources in the areas under review. In the final analysis, it would be necessary to rely on the good will and sense of cooperation of all countries concerned.
18. In the following years, delegations maintained the same positions and apart from discussions on financing secretariat activities, institutional aspects were not given special attention again until 1978. At their Fifth Joint Meeting in 1978, the IOFC and IPFC Tuna Committees discussed the issue and felt that the three following options could be considered:
(a) to provide for a better system of collection, analysis and dissemination of data and statistics at both the national and international levels with no additional institutional arrangements at this time;
(b) to strengthen the present IPFC secretariat or establish a separate tuna management secretariat within IPFC,
(c) to establish a separate body by treaty concluded outside the framework of FAO.
19. The Committees agreed that the state of development of tuna management activities was well beyond the stage referred to in option (a), while option (c), although possibly a long-term solution, involved complex political considerations that could not be addressed at that meeting. Option (b) had substantial support and it was proposed that action be taken in this regard in stages. Within the purview of option (b), the Committees recommended that FAO should prepare short- and long-term tuna management schemes, in consultation with all member countries of IOFC and IPFC and with the assistance of a tuna management specialist. The relevant proposals should be submitted to the next meeting of the Tuna Committees of IOFC and IPFC in 1980.
20. The question of financing the data collection and other activities required to allow for the management of tunas was also discussed by the joint meeting of the IOFC and IPFC Tuna Management Committees. At their Second Joint Meeting in 1972, the issue was discussed briefly without reaching any conclusion. At their Third Joint Meeting in 1975 the Committees emphasized that the development and introduction of management measures would require substantial funding but that the amount involved would be far exceeded by the cost of failing to manage. The Committees agreed that whichever structure for management decision would be finally adopted, it was necessary to prepare detailed proposals for financing that structure in the short and long-term. The Committees established a small ad hoc Committee of Nations to prepare statements on the functions, methods of operation and financing of a joint IOFC/IPFC secretariat. It must be noted that at this time the financing was only
discussed in the context of management functions being conducted by the two Committees.
21. The ad hoc Committee of Nations met twice in 1975 and agreed that the figure of US$ 300,000 annually presented by the Secretariat for an "austerity" budget for central technical support, was reasonable and could be used as general guidelines. Although there were several views as to how the cost should be shared, it was generally accepted that the principle of "user pays" should be adopted. This proposal was considered by the IPFC and IOFC Committees on tuna management at their Fourth Joint Meeting in 1976 and although some countries were of the opinion that funding should be provided by FAO and UNDP, there was general agreement that in the long term funding should be on the principle of "user pays". This was also the opinion of IPFC and IOFC. When the two tuna Committees met for their Fifth Joint Meeting in 1978, they decided that the tuna management activities should be carried out within the framework of IPFC and IOFC and furthermore, they considered that the original
proposal for a budget in the order of US$ 300 000 was far too ambitious.
22. The question of institutional arrangements for the management of the Indian Ocean tunas was not discussed by either IOFC or its Committee on Tuna Management until 1986. Two developments necessitated the serious consideration of this issue. First, as described in paragraphs 5 and 6 there was a substantial increase in the landings of tunas from the Indian Ocean. The increase which was due mainly to increased tuna fishing activities by DWFNs in the region prompted some coastal States to reiterate their concern over the lack of a proper management body to regulate tuna fishing in the region. The second development was that, by 1986, the IPTP data centre in Colombo had gathered substantial information on various aspects of tuna in the Indian Ocean and was becoming increasingly competent to provide scientific information for management consideration. In addition UNDP had repeatedly indicated that the funding for IPTP should come from the members and that the UNDP funding would
terminate in 1989.
23. At its Ninth Session (Colombo, Sri Lanka, December 1986) the IOFC Committee for the Management of Indian Ocean Tuna noted that the present institutional arrangements (i.e., a subsidiary body of a commission created under Article VI of the FAO Constitution complemented by a field project funded partly by UNDP and partly by member countries and EC) were satisfactory to meet the present needs. Several delegations expressed their concern, however, about the adequacy of these arrangements after the termination of the project. Bearing in mind the time required for changing the present structure, if needed, the Committee felt that it was not too early to start thinking about the various options available. It agreed to set up a small ad hoc group, made up of France, Japan, Seychelles, Sri Lanka and Thailand, to review in detail these options and make recommendations to the next session. The Committee also decided that in view of the growing involvement of the EC in the tuna
fishery in the Indian Ocean, the EC should be invited to participate in the work of the ad hoc group in an observer capacity. The Committee further requested the ad hoc group to inter alia consider and recommend options which would allow the EC to participate fully in any decision-making process involving questions for which the EC member States had transferred their competence to the Community.
II.2 First Government Consultation on Long-term Institutional Arrangements for the Management of Indian Ocean Tuna, 1987
24. The First Government Consultation was held at FAO Headquarters in Rome on 15 and 21 May 1987. It was attended by delegates from the five Member Nations selected by the IOFC Committee for the Management of Indian Ocean Tuna at its Ninth Session. Representatives of the UNDP and the EC also attended as observers. Although the issue of institutional arrangement for the management of tuna in the Indian Ocean had been discussed by IOFC and by the IOFC and IPFC Tuna Committees in the past, those discussions had been fragmented and touched only upon certain aspects of the issue. The Government Consultation, on the other hand, had been entrusted to discuss all aspects of the long-term institutional arrangements for the management of Indian Ocean tuna; a task which was taken very seriously with total commitment on the part of the participants.
25. The Consultation had before it a comprehensive document (IOFC/TML/87/2, April 1987) which had been prepared by the Secretariat of the Consultation on Long-term Institutional Arrangements for the Management of Indian Ocean Tuna. The Consultation noted that this document had identified three broad options for institutional mechanism to deal with the management of the Indian Ocean tunas.
(i) continuation and strengthening of the present arrangements, i.e., a subsidiary body of an FAO Commission receiving support from field projects financed by extra-budgetary funds;
(ii) creation of a new structure within the framework of FAO either under Article VI.I or under Article XIV of the FAO Constitution; and
(iii) establishment of a new body by a treaty concluded outside the framework of FAO.
26. After an exchange of views, the Consultation decided that before making any recommendation in favour of any of the options mentioned above, it was necessary to analyse some concrete issues (membership, powers, funding, etc.) which would have a direct bearing on the choice of the legal framework. The Consultation, therefore, discussed all the issues in the following order:
(a) Areas and species to be covered
27. The Consultation noted that at present the area of competence of the Committee was the same as its parent body, i.e. the Indian Ocean and adjacent seas, excluding Antarctica. It agreed that the future institutional arrangements should cover the same area, corresponding to FAO Statistical Areas 51 and 57. One delegation stressed that all species of tuna occurring in the area should be covered. Other delegations advised that the matter should be carefully discussed and that it would be necessary to list the species to be dealt with by the new management body, bearing in mind the present arrangements and the relevant provisions of the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea.
(b) Membership
28. It was recalled that Article 64 of the 1982 UN Convention on the Law of the Sea, which deals with highly migratory species, calls upon coastal States and other States whose nationals fish in a region for such species to cooperate directly or through appropriate international organizations with a view to ensuring conservation and promoting the objective of optimum utilization of such species throughout the region. The Consultation noted that some of the States whose nationals fish in the Indian Ocean for highly migratory species were not members of FAO, but that such States which were members of the United Nations or any of its Specialized Agencies could become full members of an FAO body established under Article XIV of the FAO Constitution.
29. Some delegations expressed their preference for opening membership only to the two categories referred to above while others considered that the participation of countries which could contribute substantially to the scientific knowledge of Indian Ocean tuna stocks would also be desirable. The Consultation hoped that the legal difficulties which at present prevented the EC from becoming a member of FAO fishery bodies could be overcome. The Consultation was informed that this question was under consideration by the competent organs of the EC. The EC Representative explained that full membership of EC would be important for the following reasons (i) its exclusive competence to implement conservation measures, (ii) its bilateral fishery agreements with some States in the region, and (iii) its financial rules for making long-term contributions.
(c) Functions
30. Most participants in the Consultation agreed that the future institutional arrangements should provide for full management functions. They felt that the new body should be able to recommend appropriate management measures on the basis of the best scientific information available. Some delegations strongly emphasized the need for the new body to deal with development aspects and to help coastal countries to participate more actively and more directly in the tuna fishery in the region. One delegation, while recognizing the importance of development aspects, felt that the Consultation had to concentrate on management aspects.
(d) Powers
31. The Consultation acknowledged that, under the existing arrangements, the IOFC Committee for the Management of Indian Ocean Tuna was empowered to make recommendations which, once formally endorsed by the Commission, were transmitted for appropriate action to its Member Nations by the Director-General of FAO. It felt that, if a new body was entrusted with more explicit management functions, it should also be given stronger powers, including the possibility to formulate recommendations which might become binding upon member countries unless an objection was lodged within a given period. It was noted that the adoption of such a procedure was possible for bodies established under Article XIV of the FAO Constitution.
(e) Funding
32. The Consultation devoted particular attention to this problem. It noted that the choice of a legal framework would have very important consequences on the funding of the new body. The Consultation was informed that, if it were decided to choose option (a) or (b) indicated in paragraph 25 above, the FAO Regular Programme could continue to provide some basic support, at least at the same level as in the previous years. On the other hand, should option (c) be favoured, FAO financial support could not be continued and FAO could only provide some very limited technical assistance to the new body (e.g. sending officers to attend, in an observer capacity, meetings of the new body). Option (c) would, however, allow the EC to contribute on a continuing basis to the budget of the new body for those activities for which it had been given competence by its member countries, whereas, if option (a) or (b) were adopted, the EC could only consider contributing to specific activities on
a case-by-case basis but could not participate in the funding of a permanent administrative structure.
33. It was recognized that, in all cases, financial contributions should be required from participating countries. The Consultation took note, with interest, of the information provided on the funding systems adopted by other international organizations dealing with tuna management in other regions of the world. It discussed various formulae but could not elaborate on a detailed recommendation concerning this matter. It was agreed that the volume of the catches should be one of the factors to be taken into account for assessing countries' contributions.
34. It was however unanimously recognized that this factor should be complemented by other factors such as the level of development (e.g., GNP), the commercial value of the catches, the importance of the industry processing tuna from the region, and the incomes derived from bilateral access agreements. A distinction could also be made depending on the nature of the fisheries operations which would alleviate the financial burden of countries with artisanal fisheries. The Consultation requested the Secretariat to work out possible formulae for submission to the next Consultation.
(f) Legal Framework
35. Bearing in mind all the above considerations, the Consultation was unable to reach consensus on any of the three options referred to in paragraph 25 above. The delegations of two developing coastal States felt that the continuation of a substantial FAO involvement was essential. This could, in their view, be achieved through the establishment of a new body under Article XIV of the FAO Constitution. The delegate from another developing coastal State found that the third option was the most interesting because it was the only one allowing for full EC membership. The EC representative stressed that the Community had been given exclusive competence on fishery management by its member countries and should be able to participate fully in the future international mechanism for the management of tuna in the Indian Ocean. The representative noted that this would not be possible within the existing FAO legal framework and expressed preference for the establishment of a new body by
a Treaty concluded outside the framework of FAO.
CONCLUSIONS OF THE FIRST CONSULTATION
36. The Consultation made a significant contribution to the setting up of new institutional arrangement for the management and development of Indian Ocean tuna. A number of problems remained to be solved, in particular the issue of membership which was directly linked to the legal framework of the new body, the species to be covered, the extent of power of the new body and finally the financial implications.
37. The Secretariat was instructed to circulate the report of the Consultation and document IOFC/TML/87/2 to all members of the Committee for comment and to prepare additional proposals concerning in particular the institutional framework, the funding options and the species to be covered. Once the comments from other members had been received and the required additional documentation prepared, the five countries participating in the Consultation would meet again in Bangkok, Thailand, in early 1988, to formulate final proposals for the Committee's consideration.
II.3 Second Government Consultation on Long-term Institutional Arrangements for the Management of Indian Ocean Tuna, 1988
38. As requested by the First Consultation, the Secretariat sent the Report of the Consultation, document IOFC/TML/87/2 and a letter to all members of the IOFC Committee for the Management of Indian Ocean Tuna requesting them to send their comments to the Secretariat before the end of December 1987. The Secretariat received comments from the Governments of Bangladesh, Cuba, Spain, Norway, Thailand, Tanzania, Indonesia and Japan. The views expressed by these Governments can be summarized as follows:
39. On the issue of membership, Bangladesh and Spain were in favour of full membership of the EC in any new arrangement while Japan considered it to be proper to limit membership to the coastal States and the fishing countries directly involved. On the species to be covered, Bangladesh and Indonesia wanted all species of tuna to be covered by the new body. Spain favoured those species listed in the 1982 UN Convention on the Law of the Sea while Japan considered it more appropriate to limit the species to skipjack tuna and yellowfin tuna only. On the question of power, those who commented were generally in favour of giving the new body adequate power to deal with conservation and management measures. The funding was generally agreed to be shared by FAO and contributions by the members of the new body and that members' contribution should be worked out carefully on the basis of a number of factors including the volume of catch, the commercial value of catch and GNP. As to the
legal framework only Spain and Thailand favoured a body under Article XIV of the FAO Constitution while Tanzania preferred the continuation of the present arrangement.
40. The Second Government Consultation was held at the FAO Regional Office for Asia and the Pacific in Bangkok, Thailand, from 1 to 3 March 1988. Delegates from France, Japan, Seychelles, Sri Lanka and Thailand attended the Consultation. The UNDP and the EC also attended the Consultation in an observer capacity. The Secretariat informed the delegates that the purpose of the Consultation was neither to take any binding decisions nor to negotiate a convention but simply to pave the way for the IOFC Tuna Committee which would, at its forthcoming session, formulate the appropriate recommendations for further action. The Consultation, therefore, decided to discuss all the issues separately in more detail so that the outcome of their conclusions could be discussed and decisions made by the forthcoming IOFC Tuna Committee.
(a) Area to be covered
41. The comments received indicated that there was a general consensus on the area to be covered by the future body i.e. FAO Statistical Areas 51 and 57.
(b) Species to be covered
42. The Consultation recognized that this was an important and critical matter and that it was necessary to list the species to be covered by the new body, bearing in mind the present arrangements and the provisions of the 1982 UN Convention on the Law of the Sea.
43. The delegation of Japan suggested that, because of the possible budgetary constraints, the list should be limited to skipjack and yellowfin tunas. The other delegations preferred to include all the tuna and associated species listed in Annex I to the 1982 UN Convention on the Law of the Sea as far as they are actually found in the Indian Ocean. The Japanese delegation pointed out that the tropical tunas represented an important percentage of the total catches. The recent substantial increase of catches for these species was in fact the very reason for which more stringent institutional arrangements were found desirable. Southern bluefin tuna should not be covered by the same arrangement as the one to be set up for the tropical tunas because this particular species, although spawning mainly in the Indian Ocean, migrates all around the Antarctic continent through the Indian, Pacific and Atlantic Oceans. According to the Japanese delegation, any rational management
mechanism for southern bluefin tuna should cover its whole area of migration. Since the early 1980s, Australia, Japan and New Zealand, which were the only countries exploiting southern bluefin tuna, have cooperated for their rational management. Conservation measures have been adopted and are already enforced. Placing southern bluefin tuna under the management of an Indian Ocean body would not only be scientifically unwise but could also create unnecessary duplication.
44. All other delegations stressed the need for including in the list all the relevant species using as a basis the Annex to the 1982 UN Convention on the Law of the Sea. The new body could of course decide to devote priority attention to some of these species only. In their view, the overall volume of fish catch - expressed in weight - was of little value for determining the need for a management mechanism. The status of the stocks was by far a more important factor. These delegations therefore had difficulties in accepting any proposal that the competence of the new body should be restricted to yellowfin and skipjack. Despite their circumpolar nature, southern bluefin tunas were already covered by sectorial institutional arrangements with geographically-limited competence (e.g. I-ATTC for the South-east Pacific and ICCAT for the South Atlantic) and binding powers. There was still, therefore, a vacuum to fill in the southern part of the Indian Ocean. Appropriate mechanisms
could easily be envisaged to coordinate the work of the scientists working in the different sectors of the southern hemisphere.
45. The Consultation recognized that tuna stocks should be managed primarily by those countries directly involved. Bearing in mind the concerns expressed by Japan, they indicated that a new body could establish species-based Panels whose membership could comprise the countries directly concerned and which might be given a certain degree of autonomy. It noted that even if all the Indian Ocean States do not presently participate in the fishery, southern bluefin tuna stock presents an important potential interest in the future. The delegation of France observed that management of a species having specific characteristics and involving a very small number of countries was being satisfactorily conducted within the framework of larger international tuna management bodies.
46. It was noted that the IOFC Committee for the Management of Indian Ocean Tuna was presently covering all species of tuna including southern bluefin. At its last meeting in December 1986, it had reviewed the status of the stock and had suggested a substantial reduction in the catches and supported the conservation measures recommended at the fifth meeting of Australian, Japanese and New Zealand scientists held in Shimizu, Japan, in June 1986. The Consultation agreed to leave the matter open for the moment in order to allow the IOFC Tuna Committee to assess fully all the factors involved.
(c) Membership
47. In view of the comments received and of the relevant provisions of the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea, the Consultation agreed that membership in the future body should be open to all coastal States and to countries fishing in the Indian Ocean for the species covered by the Convention.
48. The possibility of the EC's membership was discussed at length. The Consultation was informed by the Secretariat that the Basic Texts of the Organization did not envisage the participation of entities other than States in the Commissions established by international conventions under Article XIV of the FAO Constitution. It was, however, felt that the EC involvement in the activities of the new body was desirable in view of the competence in fisheries management and the substantial Indian Ocean fishing interests represented by the EC. The Consultation suggested that the EC and the FAO Secretariat should hold discussions in order to find a pragmatic solution which could allow the EC to be properly associated with the activities of the new body, if it were to be decided that the new body should be constituted under Article XIV of the FAO Constitution.
(d) Functions
49. The Consultation recommended that the new body should have full management functions. It should in particular:
- collect, analyse and disseminate scientific information concerning the status of tuna stocks covered by the Convention;
- formulate recommendations for research;
- formulate recommendations for management measures to secure the conservation of resources and promote their optimum utilization; and
- cooperate with non-member countries and international organizations.
50. It was agreed that research activities would be primarily conducted by the member countries themselves. The new body would coordinate such activities among the member countries. In addition, it would assist those member countries with limited capabilities in developing their national skills in management-related disciplines in order to allow them fully and efficiently to participate in its work. The Consultation recognized the concern expressed by several developing coastal States in respect of development aspects and the need to facilitate their more active participation in the Indian Ocean tuna fishery.
(e) Powers
51. In the light of the replies to the questionnaire received so far and of the discussions at its previous meeting, the Consultation unanimously agreed that the new body should be given the power to formulate recommendations of a potentially binding nature with the objection procedure.
(f) Funding
52. The Consultation studied this question on the basis of document IOFC:TM/88/Inf.7, which contained information on the formulae used in other regional bodies for apportioning financial contributions. As requested by the First Consultation, the Secretariat had also prepared possible formulae combining several factors such as GNP, weight of catches, and value of catches which could be used for the new body. The Consultation noted with great interest the factual information provided and agreed that the proposed formulae constituted a useful basis for discussion which could still be refined. It stressed that any formula should (i) be equitable to everyone (ii) be realistic and take into account the ability of potential members to pay, (iii) be based on simple and unquestionable data.
53. The weight to be given to each of the factors to be taken into account by the proposed formulae was carefully discussed. Some countries preferred giving more importance to the GNP. Others favoured increasing the importance of the catches component. Several countries underlined the uncertainties deriving from the estimation of the value of the catches. It was suggested that additional information and new alternative solutions be prepared by the Secretariat for consideration by the forthcoming session of the IOFC Tuna Management Committee. In particular formulae including the payment of a basic flat rate membership fee should be elaborated. Information on the economic importance of the industrial infrastructure processing tuna from the Indian Ocean should also be made available.
(g) Legal framework
54. All delegations participating in the Consultation and most of the countries which replied to the questionnaire affirmed that the new body should have close links with FAO. If a body were to be set up within the FAO framework, the necessity of giving it adequate powers and of providing for a separate budget would imply the setting up of a Commission under Article XIV of the FAO Constitution. It was however noted with concern that this solution would, at least for the moment, exclude the possibility of granting full membership to the EC.
55. At the suggestion of the representative of the EC, the Consultation further requested the Secretariat to report to the Committee on the possibility of FAO support to and servicing of a body entirely set up outside the framework of the Organization, as envisaged by Resolution No. 47/57 of the FAO Conference.
II.4 Views of IOFC Committee for the Management of Indian Ocean Tuna on Long-term Institutional Arrangements for the Management of Indian Ocean Tuna
56. When the Committee held its Tenth Session (Moka, Mauritius, 28 June to 1 July 1988), it found itself in agreement with most of the conclusions which had been arrived at by the Government Consultations. It concurred with the Consultation that the area of competence of the new body should be the FAO Statistical Areas 51 and 57. As to the species to be covered, it agreed that the list of species should be based on the list annexed to the 1982 UN Convention on the Law of the Sea. The Committee recognized the importance of management of particular species, such as southern bluefin tuna, by the countries directly concerned and felt that appropriate provision could be made in the agreement for the establishment of the new body, whereby this requirement could be accommodated.
57. The Committee recalled that Article 64 of the 1982 UN Convention on the Law of the Sea, which dealt with highly migratory species, called upon coastal States and other States whose nationals fish in a region for such species to cooperate directly or through appropriate international organizations with a view to ensuring conservation and promoting the objective of optimum utilization of such species throughout the region. The Second Consultation had recommended that membership in the new body should be open to all coastal States and to States whose nationals fish in the Indian Ocean for the species covered by the future agreement. The Committee adopted the foregoing recommendation of the Government Consultation.
58. The question of EC membership in the new body was discussed in detail by the Committee. The Committee concluded that, in addition to the two groups of States referred to above, it considered the participation of the EC, as a member of the new body, desirable because of its competence in fisheries and the substantial fishing interest which it represented, subject to the clarification of other related matters and to consideration of legal implications.
59. As regards the functions of the new body the Committee agreed with the recommendation of the Second Consultation and decided that the new body should have the following management functions:
- collect, analyse and disseminate scientific information concerning the status of tuna stocks covered by the Convention;
- formulate recommendations for research;
- formulate recommendations for management measures to secure the conservation of resources and promote their optimum utilization; and
- cooperate with non-member countries and international organizations.
Several developing coastal States emphasised that the new management body should also deal with development aspects and help them to participate more actively in tuna fisheries in the Indian Ocean. The Committee noted that this issue had also been discussed by the Second Consultation and that the Consultation had noted that complementary arrangements, outside the framework of the new body, could be considered through FAO, Organization for Indian Ocean Marine Affairs Cooperation (IOMAC) and international development banks which would allow developing coastal States to participate more effectively in the Indian Ocean tuna fishery. The Committee agreed that this matter should be referred to the next Conference when it was held to adopt a draft agreement for the new body.
60. The Committee recalled that the Second Consultation had unanimously agreed that the body should be given the power to formulate recommendations of a potentially binding nature consistent with the objection procedure already adopted by many regional fishery bodies whereby such recommendations would become binding upon members unless members lodged an objection within a fixed period of time. The Committee adopted the recommendation of the Consultation as set out above.
61. On the question of funding, the Committee recognized that any long-term institutional arrangements would have to rely on stable financial commitments. If the new body were established within the framework of FAO, the Regular Programme could continue to provide some basic support on a regular basis, but it would be necessary, in any case, that participating countries make financial contributions to the budget of the new body to enable it to discharge its management functions. The Committee recalled that both Government Consultations had examined a number of criteria which might be used in determining the financial contributions of participating countries as well as a number of possible formulae prepared by the Secretariat. The Committee considered the various formulae and the advantages and disadvantages which they presented. An additional formula was proposed by one delegation and an alternative approach (i.e., grouping of countries) was proposed by the Secretariat.
Given the number of variants before the Committee and the complexity of the matter, the Chairman decided, with the assent of the Committee, to appoint a working group to review proposals and to make specific recommendations as to which proposal or proposals should be retained by the Committee for transmittal to the Conference.
62. The working group, composed of representatives of France, Japan, Mauritius, the Seychelles, Sri Lanka, and Thailand, presided over by the representatives of Sri Lanka, reached the conclusion that two solutions should be retained for further consideration. They were:
(i) to group countries into the following categories for contributions:
A. industrial fishing countries;
B. developing coastal countries:
1. with active fishing and major export, transshipment or processing activities;
2. with active fishing but mainly for local consumption;
3. with minor fishing activities;
Each category would fund a given percentage of the total budget;
(ii) to assess national contributions, as suggested in document IOFC:TM/88/Inf.6 in Formula H, i.e.:
- 50 percent of the contribution assessed on the basis of GNP per caput;
- 25 percent of the contribution assessed on the basis of the value of catches (all species);
- 25 percent of the contribution assessed on the basis of the weight of catches (all species);
- a ceiling of 5 percent for those countries with less than 300 000 inhabitants.
The Committee requested the Secretariat to prepare an information document to be made available to the Diplomatic Conference showing the results of the application to the Indian Ocean of the funding formulae used by other international fishery commissions.
63. As to the legal framework, the Committee recalled that three options were available:
(i) the continuation and strengthening of the present arrangements;
(ii) the creation of a new structure within the framework of FAO; or
(iii) the establishment of a new body outside the framework of FAO.
Bearing in mind the consequences of the options available to it and their financial implications, the Committee preferred to adopt the solution whereby the new body would be established within the framework of FAO under Article XIV of the FAO Constitution.
64. The Secretariat then outlined the procedures and the timetable which would now be initiated as a follow-up to the meeting. FAO would prepare a draft text based on the conclusions of the Committee. The draft text would be sent for comment to all Member Nations which might be included within the scope of the agreement as well as to the countries and organizations which would be invited to the Diplomatic Conference as observers. It was recommended that the Conference should take place in spring 1989. Subsequently, the text, if adopted by the Conference, would be submitted to the FAO Conference for approval at its next session in November 1989.

III. PROGRESS TOWARDS ADOPTION OF A DRAFT AGREEMENT FOR THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE INDIAN OCEAN TUNA COMMISSION
III.1 Preparation of the Draft Agreement
65. Taking into account the conclusions arrived at by the IOFC Tuna Committee at its Tenth Session (Moka, Mauritius, June/July 1988), FAO prepared a Draft Agreement for the Establishment of the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission. The Draft Agreement was prepared in accordance with the provisions of Article XIV of the FAO Constitution and other relevant provisions in the Basic Texts of the Organization. In November 1988, the Draft Agreement, together with a Circular State Letter from the Director-General of FAO, inviting comments on the Draft Agreement, was circulated to all IOFC Members as well as to the former Soviet Union, the European Community, the South Pacific Forum Fisheries Agency (FFA), the Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission (I-ATTC), International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT), and the South Pacific Commission (SPC).
66. In response to the Letter, replies were received from Australia, France, Kenya, the Maldives, Mozambique, New Zealand, Spain and UK as well as from the former Soviet Union and the European Community. Further comments were later received from Sri Lanka, Japan, Malaysia and Thailand. The text of the Draft Agreement was then revised, reflecting the views received.
III.2 The First Conference for the Adoption of a Draft Agreement for the Establishment of the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission, 1989
67. The Conference was held at FAO Headquarters, Rome, from 3 to 7 April 1989. Twenty-five Member Nations who would be eligible to become Members of the Commission were represented at the Conference. In addition, six other Member Nations and one non-Member State attended the Conference as observers. The United Nations, the EC and UNDP also participated in the Conference. After adopting the Provisional Agenda and the Provisional Rules of Procedure, the Conference, after a preliminary discussion on how the work should proceed, agreed that the Conference examine the Draft Agreement Article by Article, with the exception of those provisions which concerned directly the legal framework of the Agreement. This issue and the Preamble were to be discussed after the deliberation on the Articles. The following discussions and conclusions were arrived at by the Conference.
Area of Competence
68. The Draft Agreement before the Conference provided alternative definitions of the area of competence, the first based on FAO fisheries statistical areas and the second on a more general definition referring to the Indian Ocean and adjacent seas. In general, countries favoured Alternative II because the migratory nature of tuna called for a definition which left a certain flexibility. One country indicated that it would not wish its exclusive economic zone to be included within the area of competence of the Commission.
Species
69. An exchange of views took place on whether the species to be covered by the Agreement should be defined generally or specified in an Annex. There was general agreement that the list of species annexed to the Draft Agreement provided a good basis for the work of the Commission. Further, consideration might be required, however, regarding the inclusion of a few species of small coastal tuna. It was noted that the list was based on that set out in Annex I to the 1982 UN Convention on the Law of the Sea.
Objectives and Functions
70. In the course of discussion of this Article, four major issues were raised. The first issue turned on the meaning of the term "management". There was general agreement that, in the context of the present Agreement, the term signifies the means of achieving the objectives of conservation and optimum utilization of the stocks covered by the Agreement. The second issue was the importance of specifying that one of the objectives of the Commission should be to ensure that the interests of coastal States were protected. The third issue focused on the need for the Agreement to refer to the concepts embodied in Article 64 of the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea. The fourth issue was raised by a number of coastal States which underlined the need for the proposed Commission to promote the development of the fishing capacity of developing coastal States.
Draft Articles on: Procedures for recommendations concerning management measures; Implementation;
and Subsidiary bodies
71. These Articles of the Draft Agreement raised the very important issue of the power of the Commission to adopt management measures which would be binding on members of the Commission. Almost all countries expressed strong support for the necessity that the Commission be granted such powers. One of the questions which remained to be settled, however, was the majority required for the adoption of such measures.
72. The provisions on implementation of binding decisions on management measures were recognized as an important element of the system. However, a number of countries expressed doubt as to the viability of an international enforcement system in respect of binding recommendations.
73. A closely related Article was that of the establishment of subsidiary bodies to deal with one or more of the stocks covered by the Agreement. It was emphasized that such a body was required at this time for the management of southern bluefin tuna. The membership, the degree of autonomy and the extent of the power which the Commission might delegate to such sub-commissions were, of course, matters of significant importance.
Finance
74. Several proposals for amendment were tabled, but the matter was not considered in depth at this stage.
Procedural Matters
75. These Articles all concerned procedural matters related to the Agreement. In the course of the discussions, a number of queries were raised, in particular on those provisions required by the Basic Texts for agreements concluded under Article XIV of the Constitution, in particular, those decisions which had to be referred to FAO governing bodies for approval.
Legal Framework
76. The basic question was whether the body was to be established within the FAO framework under Article XIV of the FAO Constitution or as an independent body outside FAO. Establishing the body within FAO would allow it to have a certain degree of autonomy whilst, at the same time, giving it the advantage of technical and financial support from the Organization. Since FAO would then have a large degree of responsibility for the management and operation of the newly created body, it would follow that a number of matters would require the approval of either the Director-General or one of the governing bodies. On the other hand, if the new body were established outside FAO, it would have independence concerning its own administration and membership, but would not benefit from the same degree of support by FAO.
77. In the course of the discussion which followed, serious consideration was given to the consequences which would flow from the choice of the legal framework of the new body. The two major consequences were: (i) the extent of financial support and technical backstopping which would be available from FAO, and (ii) membership. On the question of membership this obviously concerned both non-Member States which would be eligible to become members of the Commission and Organizations, in particular the EC, to which exclusive competence had been transferred by its Member States with respect to the management of fisheries.
78. Having reviewed the problems to which this matter gave rise as well as the consequences thereof, it was clear that the question could not be resolved immediately and deserved further in-depth study. At the same time, however, many countries appealed to those concerned to make every effort to find an arrangement or a mechanism which would allow for the technical support of FAO to be made available, while at the same time enabling participation by the EC in the proposed Commission.
Future action
79. The Conference agreed that there was need for further consultation before the Draft Agreement for the Establishment of the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission could be adopted. The Secretariat was requested to prepare a revised Draft of the Agreement annotated to reflect the comments made during the course of the Conference. This revised Draft would be circulated as soon as possible together with an analysis of the experience of other tuna management bodies and other necessary background documents. A further Conference should be convened later in the year to consider, and if possible, to adopt a draft agreement.
III.3 Views of IOFC on the Progress Concerning the Establishment of IOTC
80. At its Ninth Session held in Mah, Seychelles in October 1989, IOFC reviewed the outcome of the Conference and the progress made in relation to the future management of India Ocean Tuna. It stressed that the present arrangement could not be considered as a satisfactory solution and that the strong need for the establishment of a powerful management body remained. The Commission pointed out that the activities of IPTP should remain of primary importance and urged all its members to meet their commitments for the continuation of the project.
81. When the IOFC Tuna Committee met in July 1990 (Eleventh Session, Bangkok, Thailand), it noted that divergencies had arisen on a number of issues which had prevented the Conference from adopting the agreement. The Committee pointed that the principal matters which required further consultation were the legal framework of the new commission and the degree of autonomy which should be granted to that commission if the Agreement were concluded under Article XIV of the FAO Constitution.
82. The Committee noted that in June 1989, the EC had made a formal request to the Director-General of FAO that the question of a possible form of membership of EC in FAO be placed before the FAO Council so that the Director-General might be given a mandate to hold discussions with the EC with a view to devising a membership status that would be commensurate with the present competence of the EC. The matter was being pursued by the Director-General and would be considered by the FAO Council in 1990. The Committee, therefore, decided that while deliberation on various issues of the Draft Agreement should continue, a new Conference for the Adoption of the Draft Agreement should be convened after the outcome of the FAO Council's decision on the membership of the EC in the Organization.
83. The degree of autonomy to be given to the proposed Commission was also discussed by the Committee. It decided that a wide degree of autonomy was required particularly in relation to:
- the adoption of its own rules of procedures;
- the appointment of its Secretary and other staff;
- the adoption of its own financial regulations;
- the adoption of management measures;
- relations with other international organizations; and
- the adoption of amendments to the agreement establishing the Commission.
In order to meet the above requirements, FAO Conference Resolution 46/57 concerning the Principles and Rules Governing Agreements concluded under Article XIV of the FAO Constitution would have to be amended. Thus the two outstanding issues blocking the progress of adopting the Draft Agreement, i.e., the membership and the degree of autonomy of the new Commission, were constitutional matters which had to be resolved before any further progress was made.
III.4 Other Tuna Management Organizations in the Indian Ocean
a) Western Indian Ocean Tuna Organization (WIOTO)
84. In November 1989, a Consultative Meeting on Tuna Management and Development Strategies for Western Indian Ocean Coastal States was held in the Seychelles. Representatives from India, Kenya, Madagascar, Mauritius, Mozambique, the Seychelles and Tanzania attended the meeting. The meeting concluded that there was a need for further cooperation in tuna fisheries management between coastal States in the region. It also noted that the existing activities were mainly involved with stock assessment and biological research while there were no arrangements for the developing coastal States to maximize the economic benefits they received or could be receiving from the tuna resources in the region. A second Consultative meeting was held in May 1990 during which a draft convention, prepared by the Seychelles, was discussed as a working paper. The meeting agreed on the proposed draft Convention which was finalized and agreed upon at its third meeting held in the Seychelles in June
1991. The Convention was signed by Comoros, Madagascar, Mozambique and the Seychelles and initialled by delegations of India, Kenya, the Maldives and Mauritius. It entered into force in 1994 upon ratifications by the Seychelles, Mauritius, Comoros and India. The first Ministerial meeting of WIOTO was held in August 1994 in the Seychelles and discussed the administrative structure of the Organization. The Organization has no permanent staff and is not yet operational.
85. The area covered is detailed in Annex II of the Convention and is basically FAO Statistical Area 51 with the exception of the northeastern point is 11^oN latitude, 85^oE longitude. The membership of the Organization is open to the founding States (Comoros, India, Kenya, Madagascar, the Maldives, Mauritius, Mozambique, the Seychelles, Sri Lanka and Tanzania). Any independent coastal State bordering the western Indian Ocean whose territory is situated principally in the western Indian Ocean region may also be admitted by unanimous approval of the parties to the Convention. The species covered by the Convention are the tuna and tuna-like species listed in Annex II. These are yellowfin tuna, skipjack tuna, bigeye tuna, albacore, southern bluefin, longtail, frigate, bullet tuna, kawa kawa, narrow-barred Spanish mackerel, Indo-Pacific king.
86. The main objectives of WIOTO are to "promote cooperation and coordination among its member countries in respect of inter alia: (i) harmonization of policies with respect to fisheries; (ii) relation with distant-water fishing nations; (iii) fisheries surveillance and enforcement...; (iv) fisheries development, in particular, development of fishing capacity of members and fish technology, processing and marketing; and (v) access to exclusive economic zones of members." The structure of the Organization consists of a Board, a Committee and a Secretariat.
b) Convention for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna (SBT)
87. Southern Bluefin Tuna constitutes a stock fished in the Indian Ocean, the South Atlantic and the South Pacific. Spawning takes place south of Java, Indonesia, from where juveniles migrate eastward through the Southern part of the Australian Fishing Zone towards New Zealand. Some other juveniles from the same spawning ground migrate West through the Indian Ocean towards South Africa. Traditionally, SBT are fished by Australia and Japan. More recently, Indonesia, New Zealand, the Republic of Korea, South Africa and Taiwan (Province of China) have also been exploiting Southern bluefin tuna.
88. The total catch of Southern Bluefin Tuna of 82 000 t in 1961 fell to 45 000 t in 1980 and again to 14 000 t in 1990. Serious concern about parent stock size led to the first scientific and management meeting of scientists from Australia, Japan and New Zealand in Wellington, New Zealand, in December 1982. Since then a scientific meeting and a subsequent management meeting have been held each year to consider the SBT stock condition and discuss conservation and management measures necessary to improve the stock condition. Since 1985, total catch limit and national quota allocation, based on the recommendations of the scientific meetings, have been agreed.
89. The cooperative arrangement between the three countries led to the adoption of the Convention for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna, signed by Australia, Japan and New Zealand in May 1993. The Convention entered into force on May 20, 1994. Under Article 6 of the Convention, the Commission for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna (CCSBT) was established which held its First Meeting in Wellington, New Zealand in May 1994. The objective of the Convention (Article 3) is to ensure, through appropriate management, the conservation and optimum utilization of Southern Bluefin Tuna. The Convention covers southern bluefin tuna (Thunnus maccoyii). The membership of the Commission is not automatically open to other states. The parties to the Convention are to cooperate with each other to encourage accession by any state to the Convention where the Commission considers this to be desirable.
90. The CCSBT is empowered to decide upon the total allowable catch and its allocation as well as any other additional conservation measures. Article 16 and Annex I of the Convention contains provisions concerning the settlement of disputes between two or more parties concerning the interpretation or implementation of the Convention. Under Article 12, the Commission is required to collaborate with other inter-governmental organizations which have related objectives, inter alia to obtain the best available information including scientific information to further the attainment of the objective of the convention and avoid duplication with respect to their work.
III.5 Amendments to the FAO Basic Texts
91. At its Ninety-fifth Session in June 1989, the FAO Council invited the Director-General to explore the options for a form of membership of FAO for regional economic integration organizations for which their Member States had transferred competence in some fields of activity of FAO, along with the full constitutional, legal, financial and other implications for the Organization of such options and to report thereon to the Ninety-eighth Session of the Council in November 1990.
92. A series of consultations took place between FAO and the Commission of the European Community. The form of membership for regional economic integration organizations, eventually agreed upon, was based on the concept of the alternative exercise of membership rights. This meant that the bundle of memberships rights exercised by the Member States of a regional economic integration organization admitted to membership of FAO, should be exercised either by the member organization or its member states depending on who had competence over the matter concerned. For Article XIV agreements, where a member organization had exclusive competence over the subject matter of the agreement, and thus joined on its own without its member states, the member organization would exercise only one vote in any body established by the agreement, but would enjoy equal rights of participation with Member Nations parties to such agreement.
93. At its Hundredth Session, Rome, November 1991. the FAO Council decided on a text regarding the amendment of the FAO Constitution on membership of the regional economic integration organizations. It further discussed the desirability and the need to amend Conference Resolution 46/57 and the Appendix thereto bearing in mind a number of developments which had taken place both in the Organization and on the world scene which called for a review of the Provisions of Part R of the Basic Texts "Principles and Procedures which should govern Conventions and Agreements concluded under Articles XIV and XV of the Constitution...." with the aim of introducing greater flexibility. Among these was the establishment of Article XIV Commissions with independent budgets financed directly by the parties to the agreement, outside the framework of the Regular Programme of the Organization. Such Commissions were to be granted a broader range of responsibility and increased authority. The
council thus submitted its proposed amendments to the Conference for its decision.
94. In November 1991, the FAO Conference (Twenty-sixth Session) by Resolution 7/91, adopted the proposed amendments to the Constitution to allow for the membership of FAO by Regional Economic Integration Organizations. The Conference, also by Resolution 8/91, revised Resolution 46/57 granting more autonomy and responsibility to Commissions established under Article XIV. The amendments affected Articles II, XIV, XV and XVIII as well as some of the General Rules of the Organization. The EC (then termed the European Economic Community) was admitted to membership of FAO as its first member organization in November 1991.

IV. ADOPTION OF THE AGREEMENT
IV.1 Second Conference for the Adoption of the Draft Agreement for the Establishment of the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission, 1992
95. The Second Conference (also referred to as the Technical Conference) for the adoption of a Draft Agreement for the Establishment of the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission was held in FAO Headquarters, Rome, from 22 to 26 June 1992. Twenty-eight Member Nations and one Member Organization who would be eligible to become Members of the Commission were represented at the Conference. In addition, four Member Nations and one Non-Member State attended the Conference as observers. UNDP participated in the Conference while ICCAT, the Indian Ocean Commission (IOC), and UN Division of Ocean Affairs and the Law of the Sea (UN/DOALOS) were represented as observers.
96. The Draft Agreement prepared by the Secretariat had taken into account all the amendments to the Basic Texts of the Organization, in particular, those relating to the Membership and the greater autonomy of Commissions established under Article XIV of the FAO Constitution. During the course of the meeting, a large number of changes were introduced into the Draft Agreement and a broad measure of agreement reached on the substantive provisions. There were a number of issues which caused considerable debate and led to a number of delegations indicating that they would need to reserve their position on certain provisions pending formal approval by their home authorities. Those reservations are summarized in the following paragraphs.
97. The text of the Draft Agreement dealing with membership allowed for States responsible for the International relations of territories situated wholly or partly within the Area to become Members of the Commission in respect of such territories. The delegation of one Member Nation wished to have these provisions deleted from the text while two other delegations had reservations regarding the wording in its present form. The delegation of another Member Nation reserved its position on this provision. The Conference seeking to maintain consensus on this point, recognized that the difference of opinion on this provision was essentially one of a political rather than a technical nature, and decided to request the Director-General to refer the matter to the FAO Council through the CCLM in November 1992.
98. The question of the implementation of conservation and management measures was also a cause of concern among some delegates. They specifically mentioned the provisions of Agenda 21 which had just been adopted by the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED), and pressed strongly for the inclusion of measures that would clearly require the IOTC to introduce an effective system of inspection for reporting to the Commission on Compliance with Conservation and Management Measures in force. These delegates also supported a specific reference in the text of the Agreement for Cooperation in establishing a system observation in order to assist the Commission in gathering information for the purposes of the Agreement.
99. The issue of reservations to the Agreement was also the subject of considerable debate. The FAO Legal Counsel advised the Conference that the content of this provision was required by Resolution 46/57 of the FAO Conference as set out in Part R of the FAO Basic Texts. The Draft Agreement, taking into account the above resolution, stated that:
"Acceptance of this Agreement may be made subject to reservations which shall become effective only upon unanimous acceptance by the Members of the Commission. The Director-General shall notify forthwith all Members of the Commission of any reservation. Members of the Commission not having replied within three months from the date of the notification shall be deemed to have accepted the reservation. Failing such acceptance, the State or Organization making the reservation shall not become a party to this Agreement."
The Technical Conference strongly favoured the adoption of an Article on reservations which would take into account the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties concluded in 1969 and in force since 1980. The Conference recognized that such a text might be viewed as being inconsistent with FAO Resolution 46/57. Consequently, the Technical Conference requested the Director-General to bring this matter to the attention of the CCLM with a view to finding a way to meet the wishes of the Conference.
100. The Technical Conference, subject to the clarification of above issues, adopted the Draft Agreement on 26 June 1992, and recommended that the Draft Agreement be submitted to the One Hundred and Second Session of the FAO Council in November 1992 for its formal approval.
IV.2 Consideration of the Draft Agreement by the FAO Council
101. When the FAO Council met in November 1992, it noted that two major problems had remained in relation to the Draft Agreement as adopted by the Technical Conference. The first concerned the proposed Article on reservations which a number of Member Nations attending the Technical Conference had considered to be out of date because it did not reflect the current status of public international law. The second problem was of a political nature, arising out of the proposed participation in the new Commission of two Member States of the EC in respect of their overseas territories since the legal status of some of these territories was still a subject of dispute.
102. The Council agreed that the political problem which had arisen was not something that could or should be resolved within the framework of a technical organization such as FAO or within the context of a technical agreement but was more appropriate to the UN forum. It noted, however, that consultations were being held with the members directly concerned with a view to reaching agreement on a compromise formula. The Council also noted that the text of the Draft Agreement on reservation was in line with the precepts adopted by the FAO Conference in 1957 and set out in Paragraph 10 of Conference Resolution 46/57. That Paragraph required unanimous acceptance by all contracting parties in order that a proposed reservation take effect. The Council agreed that these precepts were no longer in line with the present practice under public international law. Consequently, the Council recommended that Paragraph 10 of the Conference Resolution 46/57 should be amended to reflect the
current state of international law. The Council thus decided that the following procedure for further action on the Draft Agreement should be followed:
(a) consultations should continue between the Secretariat and the parties concerned on the question of participation in the proposed new Commission;
(b) subsequently, the text of the draft agreement as it may be revised, should be circulated to all Members represented at the Technical Conference, and informal consultations held with them to insure that there were no problems with the revised text of the Agreement;
(c) the outcome of both sets of consultations should be referred to the CCLM at its Sixtieth Session, scheduled for April 1993, and to the Hundred and Third Session of the Council in June 1993;
(d) consideration of the formal approval of the Agreement should be deferred until the Hundred and Third Session of the Council in June 1993;
(e) a draft amendment of paragraph 10 of the Appendix to Conference Resolution 46/57 (Part R of the Basic Texts) should be prepared by the CCLM at its Sixtieth Session for submission to the Council in June 1993, for transmittal to the Conference in November 1993 for adoption;
(f) a new clause on reservations should be included in the draft Agreement along the following lines;
"Acceptance of this Agreement may be made subject to reservations in accordance with the general rules of public international law as reflected in the provisions of Part II, Section 2 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties of 1969".
(g) the Council, at its Hundred and Third Session in June 1993, would consider approval of the draft Agreement as amended, subject to the amendment by the Conference at its Twenty-seventh Session in November 1993 of paragraph 10 of the Appendix to Conference Resolution 46/57 (Part R of the Basic Texts) regarding reservations.
IV.3 Final Amendments to the Draft Agreement
103. At its Sixtieth Session in April 1993, the CCLM considered a revised text of the Draft Agreement, which incorporated certain changes on the question of membership of the Commission. The revised text intended to resolve the outstanding issue arising out of the proposed participation in the Commission of two Member States of the EC in respect of their overseas territories. When the Council met in early November 1993 (Hundred and Fourth Session, Rome 2-5 November 1993), it noted that extensive consultations had been held with the Governments of India, Mauritius, France and the United Kingdom, with a view to reaching an acceptable compromise on the question of participation in the proposed Commission. The consultations had been fruitful and a compromise formula had been proposed.
104. The Secretariat had also had informal consultations with other members represented at the Technical Conference to ensure that there were no other problems with the new text of the Draft Agreement. Written comments had been received from eight members of FAO on various aspects of the Draft Agreement. Some of the comments were of a drafting nature
but others were of a more substantive nature and related, inter alia to the following:
(a) two members had raised the issue of the status of participation in the proposed new Commission of the EC and its Member States;
(b) two members had commented on the question of reservations; and
(c) one member had commented on the issue of coastal States' rights.
The Council noted that a number of drafting suggestions submitted by FAO Members had been incorporated in the revised text. It agreed that further amendments on finances, membership, amendment and withdrawal be incorporated in the text. Finally, drafting proposals had been made in respect of "Coastal States' Rights" and it was agreed that the alternatives would be reflected in the text.
105. The Council noted that a decision to approve formally the Draft Agreement would be subject to the Conference approving the amendments to Paragraph 10 of the Conference Resolution 46/57. Also some issues requiring further bilateral negotiations were still outstanding. Thus the Council decided not to give its formal approval to the Draft Agreement at this Session but referred the Draft Agreement to the Twenty-seventh Conference Session itself for formal approval by that body.
106. At its Twenty-seventh Session, Rome, 6-24 November 1993, the FAO Conference noted the difficulties which had arisen over some provisions of the Draft Agreement. These concerned, in particular, the eligibility criteria for membership in the proposed Commission and that a series of intense negotiations had taken place over the preceding eighteen months in order to reach consensus on the wording of appropriate provisions on these matters. The bilateral discussions had subsequently progressed to the satisfaction of both parties and they were now both in a position to approve formally the Draft Agreement.
107. The Conference also noted that a number of countries had expressed concern in the Council over what they perceived to be a "double voice" for the EC and its Member States inherent in the wording of the Draft Agreement and that some countries had been reluctant to express formal approval on this issue at that time. The Conference noted, further, that the Council had considered that this was an issue that should be explored in its wider perspective in similar situations in the Organization as a whole and had decided, therefore, to refer this matter to the CCLM in order that it carry out a legal analysis of the issues involved and report to the Council at its Session in November 1994. The Conference further noted that the Council had failed to reach agreement on the wording of the Text concerning reservation at its Hundred and Fourth Session in November 1993, but that subsequent consultations with the parties most directly concerned had resulted in agreement on a
compromise wording. The Conference also agreed that Article XVI of the Draft Agreement dealing with coastal States' rights should be amended to read as follows:
"This Agreement shall not prejudice the exercise of sovereign rights of a coastal State in accordance with the international law of the sea for the purposes of exploring and exploiting, conserving and managing the living resources, including the highly migratory species, within a zone of up to 200 nautical miles under its jurisdiction."
108. The Conference further noted that the final obstacle to approving the Agreement had been removed with the amendment by the Conference earlier in its session of paragraph 10 of the Appendix to Conference Resolution 46/57 allowing for more flexibility in the type of reservations clause that can be included in agreements under Article XIV of the Constitution. It expressed its deep satisfaction that, thanks to the extensive efforts which had been deployed by the FAO Secretariat, consensus had now been reached on all aspects of the Agreement and, accordingly, referred the Resolution approving the Agreement for the Establishment of the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission (IOTC) to the Hundred and Fifth Session of the Council for its adoption.
109. At its Hundredth and ninth Session, held in Rome in October 1995, the Council adopted the following revised guidelines concerning participation in arrangements under Article XIV of the Constitution, as proposed by the CCLM:
Agreements under Article XIV of the Constitution
a) In accordance with the provisions of Article XIV of the Constitution, each agreement should set its own criteria, and terms and conditions for participation by such Member States, bearing in mind the objectives and particular conditions of the agreement concerned.
b) For agreements declared as falling within the mixed competence of a Member Organization and its Member States, the normal rules governing participation in general meetings of the Organization would apply, which eliminate any possibility of a "double voice" for the Member Organization and its Member States.
c) For agreements declared as falling within the exclusive competence of the Member Organization, the issue of participation and voting rights should be decided upon in each individual agrement by the contracting parties concerned in the exercise of their sovereign rights, in accordance with the provisions of Article XIV of the Constitution. In so deciding, the contracting parties concerned shall exercise care to avoid any possibility of a double voice for the Member Organization and its Member States in any body set up under the agreement, whether from a legal or a practical point of view.
d) In cases where the contracting parties decide that the agreement concerned should be open to participation both by a Member Organization and by individual Member States of that Organization having territories lying outside the geographical scope of the transfer of competence by those Member States to the Member Organization, such participation should be limited to participation on behalf of those territories and representing only the interests of those territories.
IV.4 Adoption of the Agreement for the Establishment of the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission, 1993
110. At its Hundred and Fifth Session, held in Rome on 25 November 1993, the Council adopted unanimously the following resolution referred to it by the Twenty-seventh Session of the Conference, approving the Agreement for the Establishment of the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission.
Resolution 1/105
AGREEMENT FOR THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE
INDIAN OCEAN TUNA COMMISSION
THE COUNCIL,
Noting
the urgent need for the establishment of appropriate machinery for the management of stocks of tuna and tuna-like species in the Indian Ocean.
Recalling
that a draft Agreement for the Establishment of the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission was submitted to a technical conference which met in Rome in June 1992.
Taking note
that the draft Agreement was further considered by the Committee on Constitutional and Legal Matters at its Fifty-ninth, Sixtieth and Sixty-first Sessions, held respectively in September 1992, April 1993 and October 1993.
Considering
the Reports of the Hundred and Second and Hundred and Third Sessions of the Council, held respectively in November 1992 and June 1993.
Noting
that, at its Hundred and Fourth Session held in November 1993, the Council recommended the approval by the Conference of the draft Agreement for the Establishment of the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission, and that the Conference, having ascertained with satisfaction that all the prerequisites for the approval of the draft Agreement were now met, had referred the draft Agreement back to Council for its formal approval,
Having examined
the text of the draft Agreement for the Establishment of the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission as submitted to the Council by the Conference and having reached full accord on a final text:
Approves, in accordance with Article XIV-2 of the Constitution of FAO, the text of the Agreement for the Establishment of the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission reproduced as Appendix D to this Report for submission to Members with a view to their acceptance.
IV.5 Endorsement of the Agreement by IOFC
111. At its Tenth Session held in Mombasa, Kenya, in November 1994, the IOFC expressed its strong support for the establishment of the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission and several members announced that internal measures had already been taken or would be taken in the near future with a view to acceptance by their governments of the Agreement. The delegate of the Seychelles reiterated his Government's interest in hosting the new Commission. The Secretariat informed the meeting that similar expressions of interest had also been received from India and Sri Lanka. The Commission re-emphasized the considerable importance of the Agreement both for coastal countries and for distant-water fishing nations and underlined the necessity of bringing the Agreement into force as soon as possible. Consequently, the Commission urged its members to accept the Agreement with minimum delay.
IV.6 The Agreement Enters into force on 27 March 1996
112. Two categories of membership are listed in Article IV of the Agreement. The first consists of Members and Associate Members of FAO that are (ii) coastal States or Associate Members situated wholly or partly within the Area; (ii) States or Associate Members whose vessels engage in fishing in the Area for stocks covered by the Agreement; and (iii) regional economic integration organizations of which any State referred to in (i) or (ii) above is a member and to which that State has transferred competence over matters within the purview of this Agreement. Membership of the Commission of this category is only subject to the acceptance of the Agreement by them. Under Article XVII (i) "Acceptance of this Agreement by Member or Associate Member of FAO shall be effected by the deposit of an instrument of acceptance with the Director-General".
113. The second category consists of States that are not Members of FAO, but are Members of the United Nations, or of any of its Specialized Agencies or of the International Atomic Energy Agency provided that they are (i) coastal States situated wholly or partly within the area; or (ii) States whose vessels engage in fishing in the area for stocks covered by this Agreement. The membership of States belonging to this category is subject to the approval by the Commission by a two-third majority of its Members (Article IV-2).
114. Under Article XVIII the Agreement enters into force as from the date of receipt by the Director-General of the tenth instrument of acceptance. Thereafter, with respect to each Member or Associate Member of FAO or States referred to in paragraph 2 of Article IV which subsequently deposits an instrument of acceptance, this Agreement will enter into force on the date on which such acceptance takes effect or become effective. The acceptance of the Agreement has been received by the Director-General from Sri Lanka (13 June 1994), Eritrea (19 August 1994), Mauritius (27 December 1994), India (13 March 1995), UK (31 March 1995), Pakistan (27 April 1995), Seychelles (19 July 1995), EC (27 October 1995), and Madagascar (10 January 1996). The Agreement entered into force upon the receipt of the Tenth instrument of acceptance from the Republic of Korea by the Director-General on 27 March 1996.
IV.7 Future Role of the Commission
115. The most important development affecting the future role of fisheries management organizations dealing with tuna has been the conclusion of the UN Conference on Straddling Fish Stocks and Highly Migratory Fish Stocks in December 1995. The Conference adopted the "Agreement for the Implementation of the Provisions of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea of 10 December 1982 Relating to the Conservation and Management of Straddling Fish Stocks and Highly Migratory Fish Stocks". The Agreement was opened for signature on 4 December 1995 and will remain open for one year. It will enter into force 30 days after the receipt of the thirtieth instrument of ratification or accession.
116. The provisions of Article 10 of the UN Agreement on "Functions of subregional and regional fisheries management organizations and arrangements" are of particular relevance to the future activities of IOTC:
In fulfilling their obligation to cooperate through subregional or regional fisheries management organizations or arrangements, States shall:
(a) agree on and comply with conservation and management measures to ensure the long-term sustainability of straddling fish stocks and highly migratory fish stocks;
(b) agree, as appropriate, on participatory rights such as allocations of allowable catch or levels of fishing effort;
(c) adopt and apply any generally recommended international minimum standards for the responsible conduct of fishing operations;
(d) obtain and evaluate scientific advice, review the status of the stocks and assess the impact of fishing on non-target and associated or dependent species;
(e) agree on standards for collection, reporting, verification and exchange of data on fisheries for the stocks;
(f) compile and disseminate accurate and complete statistical dat, as described in Annex I, to ensure that the best scientific evidence is available, while maintaining confidentiality where appropriate;
(g) promote and conduct scientific assessments of the stocks and relevant research and disseminate the results thereof;
(h) establish appropriate cooperative mechanisms for effective monitoring, control, surveillance and enforcement;
(i) agree on means by which the fishing interests of new members of, or participants in, the organization or arrangement will be accommodated;
(j) agree on decision-making which facilitate the adoption of conservation and management measures in a timely and effective manner;
(k) promote the peaceful settlement of disputes in accordance with Part VIII;
(l) ensure the full cooperation of their relevant national agencies and industries in implementing the recommendations and decisions of the subregional or regional fisheries management organization or arrangement; and
(m) give due publicity to the conservation and management measures established by the organization or arrangement.
117. Under Article 13, States are required to cooperate to strengthen existing subregional and regional fisheries management organizations and arrangements in order to improve their effectiveness in establishing and implementing conservation and management measures for straddling fish stocks and highly migratory fish stocks. The Agreement also provides detailed provision on Compliance and Enforcement (part VI) and Peaceful Settlement of Disputes (part VIII). In general, States parties to a subregional or regional fishery management organization or arrangement are obliged to enforce the conservation and management measures adopted by that body and the disputes arising from the adoption of such measures are to be settled by compulsory means should it become necessary. These provisions go beyond the present commitment by States in the work of FAO regional fishery bodies and beyond the mandates and functions of most existing fishery management organizations.
118. The requirements embodied in the Provisions of the UN Agreement have two immediate implications for existing regional or subregional fishery bodies. One is that the mandate of almost all existing fisheries organizations dealing with the conservation and management of high seas fisheries will have to be modified in order to include measures designed to improve their effectiveness. The second implication is that the existing bodies will need substantially increased budgets to implement the provisions of the UN Agreement. Thus, States are required to commit themselves both politically and financially to the work of the regional or subregional fishery bodies if the management of high seas resources is to be carried out effectively.
119. It is therefore imperative that IOTC members agree among themselves on a mechanism for the implementation of regulatory measures, monitoring, control and surveillance and enforcement, and the compulsory settlement of disputes as envisaged in the 1995 UN Agreement. Such mechanisms may eventually require further amendments to the IOTC Agreement in due course.
