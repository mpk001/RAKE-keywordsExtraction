<title>FOREST HARVESTING CASE-STUDY 5. Elephants in logging operations in Sri Lanka</title>
<section>1</section>
FOREWORD
This study forms part of a series initiated by the Forest Harvesting and Transport Branch, FAO, Rome, to assist developing countries in promoting forest harvesting systems, techniques and methods that are simultaneously user- and environmentally-friendly _ enhancing productivity, reducing wood waste and looking at the totality of forest-related activities in a holistic manner. The aim is to encourage systems that reflect local realities and make best use of local available technology, with emphasis on the importance of harmony in the inter-relationships of the people, the forests and the environment. Systems that favour local people's participation in a sustainable, sensible use of the forest and all its potential benefits are of great significance in attempts to improve local employment potentials, and hence incomes and quality of life. Helping the local communities in rural areas to develop self reliance and hence self respect is of vital importance in the overall
development scenario.
The Forest Harvesting and Transport Branch wishes to express thanks to the authors of the Case Study, Mr. Palitha Jayasekera, Add; General Manager, State Timber Corporation of Sri Lanka and Dr. Shelton Atapattu who has prepared the annex on veterinary case of the elephant.
The Case Studies already published are listed on the back cover. They may be obtained from the FAO Forest Harvesting and Transport Branch, Viale delle Terme di Caracalla, I-00100 ROMA, Italy.

ELEPHANTS IN LOGGING OPERATIONS
1. BIOLOGY
The Sri Lankan elephant (Elephas maximus) belongs to the order Proboscidea, sub-order Elephantoidea. It is the largest living land animal and the last vestige of the mammoths that roamed the world in the Eocene period. The elephant population at that time would have been freely moving in a land mass covering the Asian Region and is thus indigenous to Sri Lanka, where the forest habitat has provided the elephant with a perfect refuge, whether it is for fodder, going in search of a mate, wallowing in the dust or immersing itself in pools of water.
It is a social animal and moves about in gregarious herds. Its habits show many similarities to human society, including admirable qualities of leadership, protecting and fighting for the herd, and helping weak members. Elephants show a high degree of emotion and intellect, and some consider its intelligence second only to humans.
2. HISTORY
Man has found the elephant to be an ideal tool and beast of burden. In the third century BC, Hannibal crossed the Alps with elephants. In classical Rome, elephants participated in military pageants and were used in Roman amphitheatres. In World War II, elephants were used to carry heavy military equipment in the mud and steep slopes of the Asian war fronts.
Historically, in Sri Lanka, the elephant was used as a personnel carrier in the many wars fought in the country against invading forces. During peaceful times the ancient kings built their cities using elephants to haul heavy building material, such as granite columns, using low-bed carts.
The elephant has been used for hauling logs in forest operations for some hundreds of years, before mechanization of forest harvesting technology. However, with technological development, man gradually replaced the elephant with the motorized tractor, with greed driving the need to produce more and more in an industrialized world. Higher productivity was gained, but at the cost of heavy and permanent damage to the forest ecosystem, especially in rain forests, with consequent negative environ-mental impact. There is now much concern globally to stop such destruction, and even to stop trade in tropical hardwoods.
3. ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
It is in the context of environmental responsibility that a fresh look at harvesting of logs is necessary, having principles of conservation in mind. A careful analysis of the use of elephants to haul logs proves beyond doubt that elephants are in many ways the ideal tool for forest operations. In the fragile ecosystems of tropical wet evergreen natural forests, mechanized logging causes ten times as much heavy damage as traditional logging using animals. Damage caused is both direct and indirect, including prevention of natural regeneration _ which can lead to genetic erosion; damage to the soil structure; and hydrological modification. The elephant is at home in the forest, whether it is carrying a burden or not. It is intelligent enough to understand the terrain types, avoid obstructions and take the path of least resistance, thus avoiding the need to open the expensive and environmentally damaging skid trails needed to run mechanized equipment.
There is no doubt that the elephant is an ideal means of handling logs in a multitude of forest operations, causing minimum damage. This contributes to conservation of the natural environment and is of major positive significance in any environmental impact assessment (EIA).
4. ELEPHANTS AND MACHINES IN COMBINATION
Trained elephants can be used in combination with machines, but what is significant is the kind of machines. For instance, there is no need to use a mechanized skidder where conditions are suitable for elephant skidding. When felling and bucking are done with power saws and transport is by trucks, elephants can be used for skidding to a roadside. Short-distance forwarding on available roads by agricultural tractors or forwarders are effective tools when worked in combination with elephants.
One positive advantage of elephants in skidding is their availability, as they have no down-time comparable to that of machines when they have to wait for costly spares and repairs. In fact Bill Williams, a veteran forester and lumberjack, in his book Spotted Deer, says that he prefers elephants to machines when logging in Burmese teak forests for the same reasons. He had even made use of the elephants to raft teak logs from island to island across short stretches of sea.
The elephant in its natural habitat, like most wild creatures, is peace-loving and shy of noise and strangers. Often they show offensive traits when confronted with strange colours or loud noise. When domesticated, however, the animal accepts strange noises and machines, though warily.
In logging operations, the main tools needed are power saws, skidders, loaders and trucks, in that order. The elephant can conveniently perform three of these functions, and so is often called a _three-in-one_. It can skid logs, and also push trucks through sticky terrain. The only time it is exposed to high noise levels is when power saws, loaders or skidders are in operation, and perhaps when logging trucks start away at high engine speeds. There have been no incidents of elephants reacting to high noise levels, although they dislike such disturbances. They have come to accept the noise of traffic, both in forest operations and living in the wild state in parks and sanctuaries.
Of the five senses, an elephant's vision and hearing are not as well developed as its keen sense of smell. Perhaps that is an advantage when working alongside machines. Nevertheless, a recruit elephant engaged in logging operations is introduced to noise carefully. For example felling, de-limbing and bucking using a chain saw is done before the elephant is made to go up to the stump site to start skidding. There are instances where elephants are transported by truck over long distances, and all indications are that elephants can be trained to accept machines as part of logging operations.
5. ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES OF USING ELEPHANTS
Comparisons of machines and elephants in forestry work are many, but significant conclusions are listed below.
5.1 ADVANTAGES
_ Under forest conditions the elephant has the advantage of working in its natural environment. The trees, the terrain, rocks and boulders, streams and rivers are familiar and the animal is completely at home whilst engaged in skidding heavy burdens.
_ Reciprocally, the environment easily accepts the intrusion as natural, and comes to no harm.
_ To reach the stump site and return to the landing with a load needs a track of perhaps only one metre wide. By instinct and intelligence the animal treads the path of least resistance.
_ The initial investment to purchase an elephant is between $US 10 000 and $US 15 000, as against $US 150 000 for a wheeled skidder.
_ Monthly running cost of an elephant is in the region of $US 520, compared with $US 795 for a skidder.
_ In terms of foreign exchange, the elephant costs nothing, while machines require costly imported spares and fuel.
_ The animal is herbivorous and survives on grasses and other fodder, including climbers which can be detrimental to healthy tree growth. Thus it inadvertently exposes hibernating seeds to germination stimuli and removes strangulating tree climbers.
_ There are significant socio-economic benefits to rural communities living in remote forest villages, through providing employment as mahouts, helpers, food suppliers and other spin-off jobs.
_ In Sri Lanka, the elephant is traditionally and culturally recognized as a glorious animal.
_ Elephants do not emit polluting gases and particulate matter as motorized equipment does.
5.2 DISADVANTAGES
_ Wheel skidders and loading cranes are more efficient and faster, resulting in better productivity, but cause greater damage to the local ecosystem.
_ An elephant cannot work continuously day and night.
_ Logs have to be sniped _ at extra cost _ to offer less friction and to avoid jamming, causing minor volume losses.
6. FOREST WORK BY ELEPHANTS
6.1 SKIDDING
The most painstaking and important work undertaken by the elephant is skidding logs. The elephant sets off carrying its skidding gear around its neck to the stump site. The mahout leads the elephant with the assistance of a choker-man or foot mahout. The foot mahout is often engaged for the day on a casual basis by the concession holder.
By the time the elephant reaches the stump site the tree would have been topped, de-limbed and bucked to convenient lengths. The bucking is done to match the volume or weight of log that can be skidded by the elephant. All logs would have a minimum diameter of 30 cm, the length varying from 7 m to 10 m depending on the capacity of each elephant, and could weigh up to 2 t.
However, there are other factors, such as the shape of the log (round; with or without buttresses); the type of terrain; surface evenness; firmness of the soil; etc., which will have a bearing on the log volume and weight that can be safely skidded by the elephant. Sometimes skidding is along a watercourse or on dry land, or both. The elephant has a distinct preference to skidding along watercourses, as it can quench its thirst and splash water over itself to control body temperature. Skidding in streams can be less strenuous since the boulders offer little resistance and logs slide over them easily. An elephant's feet are susceptible to skin disease when skidding in marshy conditions, but in water streams the toes are kept clean and it is thus more hygienic. Besides these advantages, the water gives buoyancy to the log, thus lessening the effort required to move a given weight. A disadvantage is the presence of large boulders which can jam the log or make progress slow and
slippery. Ergonomically, skidding in water is ideal as it minimizes the possibility of heat stress, and is less strenuous, although it can disturb the bottom and leave bark and dung in the stream.
In Sri Lanka, elephants are made to skid logs basically by two methods, selected according to terrain type: the harness method, or the side method. The harness method is used when the terrain is flat and offers no danger of the log rolling down a slope. If this happens there is always a risk of injury to the elephant as there is no way of immediately releasing the log from the harness. Skidding on slopes is done by the side method, so that the elephant, when sensing danger, can simply jettison the bit from its mouth and release the log instantly. An elephant does not take any risk if there is danger _ however much the mahout urges it. This has been shown again and again, as elephants seem more sensitive to danger than human beings.
It is not usually necessary to skid logs uphill, but the necessity may arise, depending on the location of the roadway.
If the road is located downhill, the elephant can be made to slide logs down a chute or to roll them downhill, depending on the surface characteristics. When rolling logs, the elephant uses its front legs, knees, trunk or even the forehead to push the log. For haulage on hillsides and narrow paths, the animal should work on the uphill side and not on the lower side, as there is always the danger that the log can roll down and injure the animal.
6.2 THE HARNESS versus THE SIDE METHOD FOR SKIDDING
The harness method (Figure 1)
_ The effort needed to haul the log is distributed throughout the body, and not localized.
_ A bigger load can be handled than in the side method.
_ Ideally suited to hauling on flat ground.
_ As the entire length of the log is in contact with the ground there is more friction, and hence greater effort is necessary.
_ It damages the ground by creating gullies and compacting soil.
_ While using the harness method, the log may sometimes slide, especially when hauling downhill, and the elephant is then directly in the path of the sliding log. Instances of this nature have been observed in forest work, where the elephant has intelligently taken preventive action by side-stepping the sliding log rather than trying to run ahead. There have also been instances of accidents where the log has rolled down the slope.
_ Elephants can feed and drink whilst hauling, whenever succulent fodder is passed.
Figure 1 Elephant hauling a log using a harness
The side method (Figures 2 and 3)
_ The log is lifted slightly and this helps to get over obstructions.
_ The side method is suited for skidding on hilly terrain.
_ Disadvantages are that
_ application of effort is confined to the mouth, especially placing strain on the molars and the facial muscles, which can lead to serious dental problems later, and
_ the elephant tends to turn its head to the side of the drag, which places more strain on the neck muscles on that side.
_ The elephant is prevented from feeding itself whilst hauling.
Figure 2 The side method of haulage, with the elephant sorting logs at the landing
6.3 LOADING
Elephants are used very effectively by concession holders to lift logs into trucks, thereby avoiding the need for additional equipment. Loading is done by lifting one end of the log using a chain bound round that end of the log, in a similar way to gripping logs when skidding by the side method. The lifted end is placed on the deck of the truck (Figure 4). The chain is then slid towards the other end of the log, and the process repeated till it is firmly balanced on the deck of the truck.
Figure 3 The side method of hauling _ the elephant bites on the small branch to which the chain is fastened that is passed around the log to be hauled.
Figure 4 The elephant lifts the log on to the truck deck
The log is then pushed home against the cab guard by the elephant using its forehead or trunk (Figure 5). The elephant knows not to push too hard so as to avoid damaging the cab guard. Sometimes the elephant uses the upper part of its legs or body to prevent logs rolling. It uses its full height to the best advantage to load tier after tier of logs. Where necessary, additional height is gained by stepping on a log used as a platform. A well-trained elephant uses its intelligence, and works quickly and effectively. It takes about 45 minutes to load 7 m³ onto a truck.
Figure 5 The elephant gently pushes the log into position on the lorry deck
6.4 SORTING AT LOG YARDS
Elephants are also employed in sorting logs at landings and depots. The main functions here are rolling, lifting and pushing. The elephant uses its legs, trunk, tusks and forehead very effectively for this. The same occurs when breaking up log jams. It is interesting to witness how the elephant winds its long trunk around, sometimes using the mouth, to lift a log from a jam (Figures 6 and 7).
Figure 6 The elephant requires little space to operate in at landings. Here it is sorting out logs, while the mahout keeps watch for possible dead branches falling as the logs knock the trees. Safety gear is conspicuous by its absence.
Figure 7 The elephant requires little space to operate in at landings. Here it is stacking logs.
6.5 UPROOTING TREES
Sometimes it is necessary to uproot whole trees, especially for land clearing work, such as in levelling playing-fields and preparing building sites, or for re-planting purposes.
Elephants can easily nudge over trees up to 50 cm diameter, especially those species which do not develop deep roots. When in search of food it will not hesitate to topple trees to feed on the bark, foliage or small branches.
When re-planting rubber and coconut plantations, old stumps need to be grubbed out as they are a possible reservoir of plant pests and diseases that could attack the successor trees.
Where tree diameters are over 50 cm, it is common to use elephants to uproot the tree after ripping the lateral roots and loosening the soil. The elephant uses its forehead, trunk or foot to bear the tree down.
6.6 SNIPING
To reduce friction whilst skidding, it is necessary to sharpen, snipe or point one end of the log, the end where the drag holes are. Drag holes are about 10 cm square, and pass through the log, allowing the drag chain to run freely through the hole. The drag holes are made about 30-40 cm behind the tip of the snout (Figure 8). There is an unavoidable small loss of wood due to this, about 1% of the log volume. Sniping and drag holes appear to be the most practical way of skidding under difficult terrain conditions.

7. PROMOTION OF ELEPHANTS IN FOREST OPERATIONS
As experience with mechanized logging has accumulated, the elephant has come to be recognized as ideal for certain forest operations, both in terms of cost and in response to current demands for sensitive and responsible environmental management.
It is the adaptability of the elephant that makes it such a good tool, and in particular, logging in tropical forests in hilly terrain is very effectively done using elephants, which are at home under those conditions. Hence all encouragement should be given to forest concession holders to continue and increase their use of elephants.
In Sri Lanka, the elephant is very often controlled by uneducated and ill-trained mahouts, who may drive an elephant too hard. This can lead to the death of the animal, or the mahout's own death at the _hands_ of an infuriated animal. The mahout has intimately to know the psychological and physiological needs of the animal. The elephant has also to be trained systematically and scientifically, taking into consideration its capacity to work. One of the constraints faced in Sri Lanka is the dwindling elephant population, and hence the need for a programme of breeding in captivity.
Elephant owners in Sri Lanka do not usually allow animals to breed in captivity, for economic reasons. During the long period of gestation of 22 months and the long post-natal period, the work output of the animal is reduced or nil. One solution to this problem is to establish elephant camps, as has been done in South India and Thailand, managed by the State or an NGO. Practical training programmes on the use of elephants in logging could be introduced by agencies responsible for forest work. Such programmes should employ all possible media _ including audio-visual techniques and general publications _ and disseminate the results of research so as to promote the cause of elephant logging.
8. PRIVATE AND PUBLIC OWNERSHIP
To own elephants in Sri Lanka is a status symbol, either of social status or of wealth. Often, economic considerations of the owner come first, before the care, health and multi-plication of the animal. The public sector acts with more responsibility for the welfare of their animals, as they have easier access to veterinary services and elephant husbandry specialists, and look after their animals with due respect for hygiene. They are also not driven by such immediate economic considerations.
8.1 PUBLICLY OWNED TRAINING CENTRES IN SRI LANKA
8.1.1 The elephant orphanage
The elephant orphanage at Pinnawela, established in 1975 and maintained by the Zoological Gardens, occupies a 12 ha coconut plantation, about 80 km from Colombo on the Kandy road. In 1990, waifs and stray elephants in residence comprised 30 babies and 12 full grown adults (Figure 9).
Figure 9 A baby-sitter fondling a baby elephant in the elephant orphanage
8.1.2 The Zoological Gardens
The Zoological Gardens are located within the municipal area of Dehiwela-Mount Lavinia, some 15 km from the city centre. As with the Pinnawela Orphanage, the Zoological Gardens are publicly owned.
The Zoological Gardens are open to the public and the elephants are a daily attraction, especially for children and foreigners, as the elephants are trained to entertain visitors. There is a daily show, including circus-type performances. The population is about 14 elephants, and they are quite placid. The ages range from 6 months to 40 years. Occasional elephant auctions are held to dispose of animals in excess of the zoo's requirements.
8.2 PRIVATE OWNERSHIP
Besides those in the two publicly owned elephant centres, there are about 600 privately owned elephants. It is traditional that major Buddhist temples, such as the Dalada Maligawa, own elephants, acquiring them through donations, gifts from foreign countries, or from the Government of Sri Lanka by way of Sannas and Rajakariya, which are traditional presentations by decree by rulers and governments in power. Such decrees are part of the Buddhist culture, in recognition of the services rendered by the Buddha Sasana to the Royal Court. The principal Buddhist temples also have annual pageants. Here the elephants, numbering from a few to as many as 150, participate in processions parading the city streets, and caparisoned in attractive regalia carrying the relics of Lord Buddha.
Elephants owned by the temples and private citizens have their own training programmes, where seasoned mahouts and the owners jointly carry out basic training.
9. ELEPHANT CAMPS
The infrastructure needed for an elephant camp includes:
_ An area of slightly undulating open land adequate to support the number of elephants in the camp, with high-roofed stalls for housing them.
_ A perennial and ample water supply _ the ideal being access to a river or stream with clean running water.
_ Shade trees offering a cool atmosphere. The trees should be big enough for elephants to be tethered, especially at times of musth.
_ There should be a plentiful supply of fodder in the vicinity.
_ Proximity to veterinary services is always an advantage.
10. TRAINING SCHEDULES
The ideal age for training an elephant is when it is 10-12 years old. As with humans, this is the age at which it is easiest to mould the mind of youngsters and teach them to understand and carry out commands given in training. Young elephants can be easily disciplined by kind words, offering rewards of love, care, admiration and recognition for good behaviour. The older the elephant, the more difficult it is to train, because elephants captured after they are 10 years old will have acquired traits which are difficult to discipline. In fact, elephants bred in captivity are the easiest to train.
An elephant from the wild has first to be broken in, like a wild stallion. It is restless, easily angered, trumpets and can run amok like an uncontrolled locomotive, a reflection of its enormous strength. The first step is to subdue it. This is done with the help of fetters on all legs, binding rope around the neck and body, and around sensitive spots. Veteran monitor elephants are also made to flank the new recruit to keep it under control. Often the monitors play their role by lashing, nudging, kicking and beating the newcomer. Their mere presence is an influence on the wild elephant. For the first week the trapped elephant is starved, except to give an occasional drink. In any case the wild one is in no mood to eat and is in a state of trauma. As it gets weaker, the mahout tempts it by offering water. Gradually the elephant responds to the approach of the mahout.
An elephant's weakness is its desire to be in water. This is exploited to the full. After splashing the elephant with buckets of water or from a hose, the next stage is to lead it to a pool of water, escorted by monitors. In the meantime, the mahout gains the confidence of the elephant by feeding it with sugar cane, bananas, salt, fruit and other tempting foods. Elephants love to lie in water for hours, cooling themselves, and while it lies there the mahout would give it a good scrubbing down, with coconut husks used as brushes (Figure 10).
Figure 10 The mahout ensures the elephant has water and is cared for
The next stage in the training is to get the elephant to carry a small bundle of fodder, which could be salty coconut fronds, juicy kithul stems (Caryota urens, toddy palm), or lush jak leaves (Artocarpus heterophyllus [syn. A. integrifolia], jackfruit). The weight of such a bundle would be around 100 kg. The made-up bundle is given to the elephant to be held in its mouth, which is initially detested, but the mahout cajoles it to hold by its teeth, and sometimes an extra rope is wound round the neck to keep the bundle in place. Thus the elephant is tricked into carrying its own food by mouth. The weight is increased gradually. On delivery of the food parcel it is rewarded with immediate feeding (Figure 11).
Figure 11 The young elephant is trained by conditioning it to carry its own fodder
The food parcel is then replaced with lightweight logs of the kithul tree, which is a favourite food of elephants. This is the first lesson in handling logs, and now there is no going back. Depending on the age of the elephant and its degree of wildness, it takes 2 to 3 years for an elephant to be fully trained for forestry work. Monitor elephants are also used to demonstrate skidding and hauling of timber, and the young recruit follows the leader. A fully-trained elephant displays a touching diligence in its effort to please its trainer, on whom it is now entirely dependent for food.
Figure 12 The mahout mounting his elephant. Note the tools _ the angus and the long stick.
11. THE MAHOUT
By nature the mahout has to be a lover of animals, but has also to be tough and fearless. His physique matches, proportionately, that of the elephant in strength. Under Sri Lankan law, he is permitted to carry a pointed kris knife, which has a 20 cm steel blade sharpened on both sides, at his waist belt, in addition to the driving hook (angus). This is an auxiliary weapon used to control the elephant (Figures 12 and 14). He must be able to recognize the various moods of the animal and know the principal nerve centres. A touch or a nudge on a particular nerve centre makes the animal responds instantly. Often a wayward animal can be controlled simply by using the angus on such a spot.
The mahout has to be knowledgeable in treating his elephant for many basic ailments, and this comes through experience. An elephant has a retentive memory, and it is believed that an elephant never forgets. There have been quite a few instances where an elephant has taken revenge later on a hard-driving or cruel master.
The choker-man, or apprentice, is usually disliked by the animal as the animal knows that the choker-man is the real taskmaster. Occasionally the elephant chases the choker-man, who is unarmed, and throws things at him. Hence the choker-man operates at a respectful distance, always ready to bolt in case of trouble. The choker-man is the logical successor to the mahout.
An ideal mahout shows his love for the animal and looks after it, both whilst working and during his free time, including putting the elephant into a water bath, brushing it down, manicuring its toes, scrubbing behind the ears, etc. Feeding and tending complete the relationship with the animal, and thus the animal's respect and regard for the mahout is assured, and the two become inseparable.
There is a case reported of an elephant standing guard over its mahout who had drunk too much liquor at the end of a hard day's work and had passed out, and the elephant would allow no-one to approach.
12. THE MAIN COMMANDS
Communication between mahout and elephant is limited to a vocabulary of about 25 Hindi words, obviously coming down from the Indian pannikkars, the original trappers.
These commands are well understood by the elephants. It comes as a surprise to see how the elephant carries out all functions expected of it on the basis of these few words. Obviously part of it is the animal's capacity to understand without being told _ intuition. There are no words to tell the elephant how it should load a log onto a truck. It is astonishing to see how the elephant pushes the log on the lorry deck to just short of the cab guard. Whilst skidding, any obstruction it meets on the skid trail is avoided by taking the path of least resistance and without being told by the mahout. The mahout sometimes rides the elephant straddled across the neck. The mahout also guides by using his feet, heel and toe to nudge the elephant behind the ear and other sensitive spots of the body, to which the elephant responds.
The main commands are single words:
Hathderi _ Bite
Pitchet _ Release
Udderi _ Lift
Daha _ Proceed
Puru _ Push
Deri Daha _ Proceed with load
Dana Puru _ Kneel down
Dana Daha _ Kneel and Push
Hide _ Lie down
Diga _ Spread down
Theth theth _ Go back
Bila _ Lift log
In addition to the driving hook, the mahout also has a long rod which he does not hesitate to use on the elephant like an old-fashioned school teacher on an obstinate charge. Sometimes the mahout feints, as if to use the hook or the rod, to which the elephant grimaces in response and hastily carries out the command.
13. WORK PROGRAMMES
The daily working routine depends on geographical and climatic considerations. In the hot, humid southwest part of Sri Lanka, the elephant is given a morning bath from about 07.00 to about 08.30. It works from 09.00 to 16.00, including skidding and loading. After a day's work the elephant is given a second bath and is allowed to feed. However it prefers to rest during the hottest part of the day, i.e., about 12.00 to 13.00. At higher elevations, where it is cooler, elephants work from 08.00 to 14.00, and are then bathed.
As with humans, an elephant needs about 7 hours of sleep a night, usually from 22.00 to 05.00. Being a voracious feeder _ in keeping with its body size and needing up to 250 kg of food and 180 l of water daily _ up to 5 hours are spent daily in feeding. In the case of a domesticated animal, it does not have to go in search of food. Feeding is mainly before and after work, but in between, whilst working, it is common to see elephants browsing on whatever is edible alongside the skid trail.
An average elephant can work 6-7 hours, but needs a few minutes rest at regular intervals. Whilst skidding a log it takes its own time, resting from 1-2 minutes after each heave. In Sri Lanka there are 6 working days each week, but are according to religious rites. Thus physical labour is not performed on poya days _ the new moon, quarter moon, half moon, three-quarter moon and the full moon days, and the elephant too is rested on these four days of the month. The calendar therefore follows the Buddhist ritual rather than the accepted Gregorian almanac, and Sunday is a working day if it does not fall on one of the moon days.
Elephants work throughout the year, other than the period of 2 to 3 months which is the _musthing_ period for bull elephants. During this period of musth there is secretion from the special frontal glands of the head. This is a physiological phenomenon denoting sexual readiness and proves sound health. When in this state, the elephant is tethered to a tree and fettered on all four legs. The animal is kept in isolation, with plenty of shade, food and water. The elephant is very restless and can be extremely dangerous, so that even the mahout is cautious when approaching it.
Under conditions of high temperature the elephant suffers from heat stress, with resultant lethargy, and during summer in Sri Lanka, i.e., from February to April, elephants may not be employed in fulltime work due to the danger of heat stress.
In general, considering the poya holidays, summertime, musthing periods, time taken to participate in cultural pageants, etc., elephants work about 200 days/year.
14. SKIDDING DISTANCE
The Asian elephant weighs about 5 t when it is full grown and is 3 m tall at the shoulder. The estimated hauling power is about half its weight. It has some 40 000 body muscles powering the haulage effort. However, its formidable size has no bearing to its haulage capacity. This may be more a psychological safeguard. The speed of hauling is approximately 2 km/hour, with frequent stops for rest. The best and most economical distance for skidding is 2 km, although it depends on several factors, including terrain, soil, undergrowth, buttressness and weight. Without load, an elephant takes at least 1 hour to cover 3 km. An average weight of 1 t can be carried in about 2 hours over a distance of 4 km, calculated on the round-trip time. It is common for an elephant to haul about 3 to 4 tons/day, depending on the weight of the timber. This is approximately a truck load. The maximum distance haulable daily by elephants is about 7 km, and that is in water.
15. DRAGGING GEAR
15.1 HARNESS METHOD
In the harness method an braided 8-ply rope made out of a woody climber (such as Combretum ovalifolium or Dalbergia sisgoo) is put around the animal's neck. Since such lianes have no significant nodes and long internodes, they are ideally suited. If necessary, before weaving the ply, the climber is beaten to make it soft. In addition, further padding is added, using old gunny sacks, especially at the points where the harness touches the shoulders (Figure 13). The diameter of the rope is about 8 cm.
Figure 13 The harness _ a loop of plaited lianes to which is attached a loop of chain. The areas where there is most rubbing are provided with padding to protect the elephant.
Two unequal sized chains of about 8 m and 5 m run from the harness, one on either side. The longer chain is passed through the drag holes so as to avoid the knot getting close to the drag holes and jamming. The chain is made up of steel links 15 mm thick, and is an ideal tool since it has no tension and cannot be a source of danger to the animal. The padding and the softening of the harness is done to prevent chafing of the neck and shoulders. However, the mahout takes special care to massage these parts whilst bathing. Oils extracted from the neem tree (Azadirachta indica) and the mi tree (Madhuca longifolia) are vigorously rubbed into the neck and shoulders after the elephant's day's work to help keep them in a healthy condition.
15.2 SIDE METHOD
In the side method, the same kind of woody climbers are used to make the ropes, but the elephant holds them with its molars. The juice of these climbers is considered of medicinal value and is believed to help the animal's set of teeth. The stout climbers have diameters of about 4 cm, and the length would be 2 m (Figures 3 and 14).
The load is attached to the chain, which either passes through the drag hole or is wound round the end of the log. The other end of the chain is knotted to the end of the climber. The free end of the climber is picked up by the elephant and gripped by its powerful molars. The length of the chain is adjusted so as to give a slight lift to the end of the log. This is to reduce friction and ease its getting over obstacles. A shortened chain helps in particular when loading.
There have been no major developments in dragging gear over the years.
16. AIDS TO SKIDDING
When skidding in marshy and soft soils, it is often necessary to reduce friction. Logs or poles are placed horizontally at right angles to the skid path over which the log travels. This is somewhat similar to the _kuda kuda_ system of Malaysia.
Sometimes a _Y_ shaped branch of a tree is shaped as a sledge to hold 5 to 8 railway sleepers where the terrain is marshy or boggy. This is a popular tool in hauling on long watercourses without obstructions like boulders. The lower limb of the _Y_ is skidded first, whilst the load is rested across the two other limbs. This is called _padawa_ in the local language.
Mechanical equipment, such as pulley blocks, are not used in ground skidding.
17. THE DRIVING HOOK
The driving hook is also called the angus. It comprises a semi-circular hook _ about 4 cm across _ and a single prong about 5 cm long, and is made of iron. This is mounted on a good quality pole 2-2.5 m in length. The mahout when standing should be able to reach to the highest part of the elephant's body with the angus. Both the prong and the hook are most painful when used on particular nerve centres. Often the mahout uses it on other parts of the body when the elephant is obstinate and gets out of control. The angus and the mahout are inseparable, because his very life sometimes depends on it. When the mahout mounts the elephant, the angus is with him and from this position he can reach any part of the animal's body (Figures 12 and 14). Sometimes the very sight of the angus keeps the animal under control.
Figure 14 The side haulage harness and the angus
18. FETTERS
Fetters can either be made out of manila rope or steel chain. Chain is used only after domestication, whilst rope is used at the time of capture to prevent any permanent damage to limbs when the animal strains to escape. The rope or chain encircles the ankle, and is sufficiently loose to prevent cuts and chafing. At the time of capture all four legs are fettered, but with domestication the rear legs are left free. However, during musthing and as a precautionary measure when elephants are paraded in processions and pageants, foot-cuffs are additionally used on the hind legs (Figure 16).
The fetters on the front legs _ unlike the foot-cuffs _ are free, with 10 m of chain leading from each foot and folded on the neck (Figure 15). This arrangement is to ensure recapture should the elephant break away. The folded chain on the neck will eventually fall as the animal wanders about, and it is easy to trace and tether the animal to a tree. A bell is often hung around the neck for the same purpose.
Figure 15 Normal fetters and attached loose length of chain
19. TECHNOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENTS IN THE USE OF ELEPHANTS
Whatever developments have taken place in Sri Lanka have been the result of the experiences of owners and mahouts, and purely on a trial and error basis. No systematic research has been done to improve technical aspects of the use of elephants. Sri Lanka is therefore not in a position to advise on the use of elephants, other than what is currently practised.
It is a matter of regret that there have been no developments in working methods or even attempts to improve gear design. There is no organization or individual carrying out any research to this end. The age-old, traditional use of climbers, ropes and chains continues and is considered satisfactory. However, it is a matter for some concern, as the use of the side method of haulage involves gripping the climber with the mouth, which places considerable, uneven pressure on the elephant's jaws, teeth _ especially the molars _ and mouth.
Even the harness method relies on only a few muscles, primarily at the shoulder and the neck. Ergonomically speaking, efficiency could be improved if the weight could be more equally distributed throughout the muscular system.
In this respect it could be advantageous to look into developments elsewhere in Asia. In Thailand and India there are elephant training camps of a much better-organized pattern than in Sri Lanka. The improvements made to harnesses in Thailand deserve closer examination, and perhaps warrant technology transfer. Tandem carriage and team work, as practised in Thailand, are sound examples of coordinated work. The need for improved technology is more acute in high terrain hauling than on the flat. It might even be considered immoral to use animals to carry heavy loads on flat ground when options like agricultural tractors are available. Hence, the elephant must be used sparingly, and where it has a natural advantage, such as in difficult tasks like skidding in high terrain, where use of machinery causes environmental damage.
20. POTENTIAL FOR DEVELOPING IMPLEMENTS FOR SKIDDING
There would appear to be some potential for developing implements for skidding, but in the Sri Lankan situation the timber resources released for felling are confined to scattered pockets of 5 to 20 ha working blocks. These are too small to warrant high technological investments. The terrain types can vary from site to site. For example, it could seem appropriate to use a sledge along a stream, if the rocky stream basin is rendered manoeuvrable for such a sledge. But blasting rocks and obstructions is costly, especially when operating small forest concessions.
On the other hand, if there is an annual cut of at least 100 ha a coupe in a series, it could be worthwhile developing tools to assist in elephant haulage on a definite drag path, be it a watercourse or an extraction path. As discussed earlier, logging carts with wheels, sulkys, etc., may not be practical due to the instability of such vehicles on slopes. The wheeled sulky drawn by horses in Finland is used only on relatively flat terrain. It would be an interesting exercise to see if such equipment could be made to operate with safety on steeper slopes.
21. PRODUCTION VOLUMES
The figures below are based on average round-trip times. The terrain classifications are, broadly speaking, easy, average and difficult respectively. The distance and time are kept constant, the variable being the production according to terrain class.

2.5 m³
II (average)

4 km (round trip)
2 hours
III (difficult)
1 m³
Alternatively the volume can be kept constant while the distance/time can vary.
22. PRICES AND COSTS OF ELEPHANTS
There is naturally a significant added value for elephants after training. It is assumed that all elephants can be trained. The criteria for fixing the price of an elephant are: age; docility; sex; state of health; and body weight.
For example, a fierce animal can be a better worker, but due to its fierceness the owner would prefer to get rid of the animal rather than risk the lives of humans or damage to property.
In Sri Lanka at the time of writing (1991), the cost of an elephant in good health between 10 and 20 years old is about $US 12 500. If it is a cow elephant, it costs 20% more as she does not musth and so there is less downtime annually, assuming she is not allowed to breed. With advancing years the price of an elephant will decrease. By the time it is 65 years old it is time to retire from heavy work. Thereafter it would be used to train, monitor, transport fodder and other light work, such as participating in pageants, processions, circuses and in tourism.
The best age for a working elephant is between 25 and 50 years old. At 25 years old, after training, it would cost about $US 15 000, and gradually increase in value to a peak at about 45 years old, when they can be sold for around $US 20 000.
An elephant between 5 and 10 years old can be sold for $US 7 500, reflecting the fact that, as in humans, mortality in this age group is high, and therefore there is more risk in the investment.
The cost of hiring an elephant for 2 km round trips, with mahout and choker-man, for a working year (200 days) would be $US 5 200. On this basis, the hire charge would be $US 26/day or $US 3.25/hour approximately. The value per cubic metre of logs skidded by an elephant on a 2 km round trip would be $US 3.25.
On a daily basis, cost items are: (Sri Lankan rupees)

CLINICAL BIOLOGY AND CARE OF THE ELEPHANT
Based on the work of Dr Shelton Atapattu
A-1. NATURAL HISTORY
Elephants are in the order Proboscidae, with two species: Elephas maximus, the Asian elephant; and Loxodonta africana, the African elephant.
In Sri Lanka the elephant in the wild is now mainly confined to areas of dry deciduous forests, where vegetation is mainly thick, thorny, impenetrable acacia species. The wild population was estimated to be 1 800 to 2 000 animals in 1990. The Asian bull elephant can reach 3.3 m in height at the withers (shoulder), and a body weight of 5 500 kg. The females can reach 2.7 m at the withers, and a body weight of 4 000 kg. In Sri Lanka, the average adult male elephant reaches a height of 3 m at the withers, with a weight of 4 000 kg. Females vary between 2.0 and 2.5 m at the withers, with a weight of 2 500 to 3 500 kg.
The Asian elephant has a convex-shaped back, a trunk with one finger, ears much smaller than those of the African elephant, and does not have a smooth skin. No females have tusks, and only about 5-7% of bulls have tusks, depending on the sub-species. Some Sri Lankan bulls and cows have rudiments of tusks, called _tushes_.
Thermoregulation is a problem for elephants, and they need adequate shade during the greater part of the day, and live in areas where there is a plentiful and perennial supply of food and water. They prefer to have large foraging areas, and keep on expanding their foraging space by pushing down, breaking or debarking trees, which ultimately degrades wooded areas. Elephants spend about 70% of their time foraging, consuming about 150 kg daily of a mixture of foliage and grasses. Typical sources of fodder and forage are tamarind (Tamarindus indicus), jak or jackfruit (Artocarpus hetero-phyllus), pota (Pothos scandeus), dadep (Erythina variegata, [syn. E. indica]), sugar cane (Saccharum officinarum), wood apple (Limonia acidissima [syn. L. elephantum]), banana and plantain (Musa spp.), coconut (Cocos nucifera), and breadfruit (Artocarpus altilis), but grasses form the bulk of their food. Their feeding rate varies with the type of foliage available. Thus succulent, luscious sugar
cane is consumed faster than any other type of vegetation.
An adult elephant drinks an average of 180 to 270 l/day of water (40 to 60 gallons), but this is more in higher ambient temperatures. Twice daily watering is ideal for an elephant.
In Sri Lanka, owners of elephants do not give any concentrates to their elephants. They are fed mainly with tree foliage and grasses.
Wild elephants invade the naturally occurring salterns in the Southern Province of Sri Lanka from time to time to obtain salt.
A-2. REPRODUCTION AND LIFE CYCLE
Wild cow elephants attain puberty between the ages of 14 and 17 years, but domes-ticated elephants with good nutritional status could attain puberty at the comparatively early age of 8-10 years. Males mature more slowly, becoming sexually mature in domestication by the age of 10-12 years at the earliest. Male elephants can mate at any time during the year. A female in oestrus mates with several males. The average gestation period is 22 months ±1 month. Diagnosis of pregnancy in wild elephants is extremely difficult. However, during the last three months of pregnancy the mammary glands become enlarged and with some milk secretion even before parturition.
After birth the mother looks after the calf for nearly 3 years, and it is during this period that the calf matures, learning the routes to water holes and foraging areas. A female usually produces a calf every 5-7 years, and some of them can continue calving to 55 years old. This pattern of breeding occurs only if the entire family group is left undisturbed, without extraneous factors to disrupt their normal life styles.
In domestication, an elephant is most productive between 20 and 50 years of age, and after the age of 50 they are gradually transferred to lighter tasks, and retired at 60, when the only work expected of them is to fetch home their fodder from harvest sites and periodically to be used for ceremonial work.
The life span of an elephant is up to 100 years, comparable to that of man. In Sri Lanka, most domesticated elephants die when they are about 40-50 years of age, especially amongst the timber logging elephants. This is commonly due to tuberculosis.
Bull elephants exhibit _musth_ annually if in good health. It indicates good physiological condition and sexual preparedness. During this period, usually lasting from 1 to 3 months, the temporal glands become inflamed and swollen, accompanied by intense pain. There is an excessive, oily secretion of fluids from the pores of the temporal glands. A bull elephant in musth is aggressive in behaviour, restless, dribbles urine, and uncontrollable. They are kept away from all work and ceremonial functions, and kept securely tethered (Figure 16), well fed and bathed, and certain herbal oils are applied in the region of the temporal glands to relieve the pain.
Elephants that are unhealthy or whose nutritional status is poor would not come into musth annually.
Figure 16 Bull elephant in musth, and the strong fetters needed to control him
A-3. REMOVALS FROM THE WILD
In general in Sri Lanka there are no records kept of removals for domestication from the wild herds. However, during 1974, permits were issued to private elephant owners on the payment of a fee to the Department of Wild Life Conservation, licensing capture of elephants taller than 7 ft (2.15 m) from "pocketed herds" for domestication. Issuing permits limiting captures to elephants 7 feet or more in height meant removal from the pocketed herds of the animals that cause most trouble. Some of them even turned out to be man killers.
The allowed method of capture was the traditional one of noosing. The capture of elephants by this method was successful in areas where there were big trees, both to lay the nooses and also to tether the elephants after capturing them.
A major post-capture problem was aftercare. Some adult elephants, in their attempts to break away from the manilla leg ropes, cut themselves badly, and secondary infections developed. Many of the elephants died of blood poisoning. The number of deaths was more than otherwise might have been because the elephant owners preferred to use the local traditional herbal medicines for treatment, on the grounds of cost and that they were considered better than "western" treatments.
Elephant capture using drug immobilization was first tried in Sri Lanka in 1974. Seven adult elephants (_7 ft (2.15 m) high) and one baby elephant (4 ft (1.20 m) high) were captured. The baby elephant was sent to the elephant orphanage at Pinnawela, Sri Lanka, and six of the adults were auctioned. The seventh had to be destroyed.
The drug used for this capture operation was M-99 (Reckitt), but it was found that double the standard dose for an African elephant was needed. Because of the thorny and impenetrable nature of the scrub jungle that was the wild elephants' habitat, it was necessary to use a small bulldozer to track the darted animal through the dense scrub.
A-4. CARE OF ORPHANS
In Sri Lanka, an average of 30 to 40 wild elephants are killed each year, leaving about 20 orphaned baby elephants. Most of these orphaned baby elephants have been rescued by villagers or by the staff of the Wild Life Department, and handed over to the Pinnawela elephant orphanage. These baby elephants are often in a very poor state of health, with infected wounds, and suffering from malnutrition and gastro-intestinal and respiratory tract infections. During the early years of the orphanage most of the baby elephants died. Problems arose because villagers had fed them with cow or buffalo milk, which are not suitable for baby elephants. Present practice is to use an artificial milk powder formulated for humans.
The attendant preparing the milk must observe good hygienic practices, and all utensils used for the preparation of milk for baby elephants should be kept absolutely clean, as should be the bottle. The feeding bottle can be a normal 75 cl bottle (standard Scotch whisky bottle!) with a 4 cm length of 2 cm diameter rubber hose as a teat.
During the first three months the baby elephants consume at least 3 to 4 lbs (_2 kg) of infant milk powder per day, dissolved in well-boiled water, and given to begin with at 3 to 4 hour intervals. This rises to 6 lb/day (_3 kg/day) by the age of 9 months to 1 year. Some "babies" continue taking milk and depend on it totally for longer periods, going up to nearly 1¾ years. In addition, the babies are given 100 g of rice overboiled into rice gruel, together with some sugar-cane syrup.
Nearly all baby elephants coming to the orphanage in Sri Lanka need treatment for enteritis, for which a kaolin-pectin mixture is used, accompanied by antibiotics and vitamin supplements. This reduces mortality considerably.
The average cost of milk foods and medication in the orphanage at Pinnawela were (1990): SL Rs. 35 000 to 40 000/yr. This ignores staff costs.
Care is taken to allow new entrants to the orphanage to have social contact with the herd. This provides social reassurance due to the suckling reflex (as the sub-adult females allow the babies to suckle their nipples even though there is no milk) and cross inoculation of bacterial microflora from the saliva of the juveniles and sub-adults help develop resistance in the babies to some common bacterial infections.
A number of baby elephants are rescued after falling into gempits or unprotected wells. They usually have wounds of the trunk and mouth. These wounds are cleaned well with soap and water, and finally cleaned with glycerine, followed by a course of antibiotics.
Intestinal colics are frequent in baby elephants, when they suffer from excruciating pain and very often roll on the ground screaming. This requires prompt veterinary attention.
A-5. COMMON DISEASES AND DISORDERS OF ELEPHANTS
Elephants are susceptible to a number of diseases, the occurrence of many of which can be minimized by regular vaccination. These include rabies, tetanus and anthrax. In Sri Lanka, anthrax is not a current problem, but domesticated elephants and the elephants at the National Zoological Gardens are immunized against tetanus and rabies annually. However, as repeated inoculations may cause anaphylactic reactions, the elephants that are vaccinated have to be kept under observation for the appropriate period after immunization.
Infectious diseases of elephants include tuberculosis, haemorrhagic septicaemia, trypanosomiasis, pyroplasmosis, foot and mouth disease, pox, bacillary necrosis, salmonellosis, streptococcosis, babesiosis, helminthiasis and ectoparasitism, in addition to the previously mentioned rabies and tetanus.
There are no known cases of rinderpest; clostridial diseases (other than tetanus) such as gas gangrene, blackquarter or botulism; glandus; pleuropneumonia; actinobacilliosis; actinomycosis; listeriosis; leptospirosis; nor of diseases due to the numerous viruses and protozoa which can infect domestic cattle.
A-5.1 TETANUS
This is caused by an anaerobic, spore-bearing bacillus, Clostridium tetani. This organism lives freely in the bowels of many mammals. The organism enters the body mainly through some injury, especially if the sole of the foot has open wounds.
The clinical symptoms are general dullness; changed gait; and the muscles of mastication are very badly affected, especially of the lower jaw. The slightest disturbance invokes severe muscular contractions.
Adult elephants should be immunized against tetanus by administering 4 000 IU of tetanus antitoxin _ which would give active protection for up to 2 weeks _ at the same time as the toxoid is administered. This is repeated after a month. Annual booster doses of toxoid should be given in order to maintain immunity.
A-5.2 ANTHRAX
Anthrax is an acute infection (caused by Bacillus anthracis) with a high mortality rate. It occurs in enzootic and epizootic forms in tropical countries. This disease is well known in elephants, but has been eliminated from Sri Lanka. However, haemorrhagic septicaemia has symptoms similar to those of anthrax, making clinical differential diagnosis difficult, and blood films have to be examined for definitive diagnosis. Where anthrax is endemic, it is best to immunize regularly.
A-5.3 HAEMORRHAGIC SEPTICAEMIA
Haemorrhagic septicaemia is a common infectious disease, especially amongst wild elephants. In Sri Lanka there have been outbreaks every 2 or 3 years in almost all the provinces of the country during the past 25 years. This disease is caused by a bacterium, Pasturella multicida (Type I). Other serotypes cause an acute septicaemia. Haemorrhagic septic-aemia appears when animals are under stress, such as when rain sets in immediately after a severe drought. Exhaustion and chilling are also precipitating factors. Within a few hours of infection the elephant commences to salivate, rigor sets in and within 24 to 48 hours the elephants die. Wild herds cannot be immunized and so the suscept-ible elephants die, although the mortality rate is usually less than 10% in any given herd. The disease is so acute that clinical symptoms barely develop. Symptoms are: anorexia, frequent yawning, swellings of various sizes _ either circumscribed or diffuse _ on various parts of the body.
Swelling is usually noted in the region between the jaws, in the neck, shoulders, under the abdomen, groin and between the hind legs, with lameness. There is respiratory distress, and convulsions precede death by suffocation. The tongue is usually dark in colour and the lining of the mouth is coated with thick saliva. The palate may be dark and with mulberry spots. Urine is very off-coloured, and scanty. Where domesticated elephants are in contact with diseased cattle or buffaloes, it is strongly advised that the elephants be immunized.
A-5.4 TUBERCULOSIS
Elephants are susceptible to the human type of Mycobacterium tuberculosis and therefore attendants should be TB-free. There is no evidence that elephants are susceptible to bovine or avian types of TB.
Tuberculosis is predisposed in elephants by stress resulting from factors such as severe punishment; heavy work without adequate rest, i.e., continuous timber logging; bleeding from wounds; being subjected to regular bouts of thermoregulatory imbalance; drinking polluted water; or undernutrition.
A-5.5 OTHER INFECTIOUS DISEASES
The foot-and-mouth disease virus is said to be recorded in elephants in full living condition. Mortality is nil and no symptoms appear.
Clostridial enterotoxaemia has killed several elephants and baby elephants. Clinically the patient suffers from acute diarrhoea, lack of appetite and a mildly elevated temperature, in the region of 99_-100_F (37.2_-37.8_C). Therapy is based on fluid replacement by administering normal saline drips, coupled with high doses of antibiotics and supportive therapy for full-grown adult elephants.
A-5.6 RESPIRATORY TRACT INFECTIONS
Typical clinical signs, especially in the case of pneumonia, tracheitis and bronchitis, are that the patient develops a copious flow of purulent exudate dripping from the trunk; coughing; laboured breathing; pain; fever; copious lacrimal secretion; and increased respiratory rate.
Treatment of infections of the respiratory tract involves parenteral administration of broad-based antibiotics and supportive therapy.
A-5.7 DISEASES OF THE FEET
Foot rot is common in domesticated and wild elephants, where the sole of the foot gets worn and bacterial infection sets in. Treatment consists of keeping the elephant under clean conditions, washing the soles of the feet daily with a 5% copper sulphate solution, a 10% formalin solution and finally painting the affected area with Stockholm Tar. This is reinforced by a broad-based antibiotic administered parenterally.
Other precipitating factors for foot rot are overgrown soles, cracked soles, cracked heels, overgrown nails and split nails.
A-5.8 DISORDERS OF THE DIGESTIVE SYSTEM
These include colics, diarrhoea, dental abscess, caries, constipation, foreign body ingestion, intussusception and hepatitis.
If there is improper development of the molars, mastication of food is impaired and the general physical condition of the elephant deteriorates. Therefore measures have to be taken to correct the malformed molars.
Colics in baby elephants being fed milk are often the result of unhygienic milk preparation.
In juveniles, sub-adults and adults, colics are very often caused by sudden changes in diet _ especially of concentrates _ or consumption of unusually rich food.
Clinical signs of colic are abdominal posture, frequent micturition, biting of the tip of the trunk, nystagmus (in very acute cases) and excruciating pain.
Treatment includes liberal amounts of soap water enemas, and administration parenterally of an analgesic. As signs of relief appear, standard food should be commenced, in small quantities until digestion returns to normal. All rancid concentrates should be removed.
There are many instances where elephants have died of asphyxia due to a large object _ such as a husked coconut _ being lodged in the pharynx. In such instances the patient has to be anaesthetized and the obstruction removed.
Elephants that have eaten large quantities of earth and gravel can suffer from intestinal colic as a result. Again, large quantities of soap water enemas are given and an analgesic.
Diseases of the liver are fairly common at all ages. Icterus is often the clinical indication of liver dysfunction. Liver function tests should be done to assess the extent of liver damage, and blood smears examined for any protozoa that may affect the liver.
A-5.9 INFECTIONS OF THE URINOGENITAL SYSTEM
Infections of the urinogenital system are quite common, and include urethritis, nephritis, neoplasia of the reproductive tract, and post-partum metritis.
Clinical signs of urethritis are obvious pain when urinating, and urinary incontinence. Definitive diagnosis requires culture of a urine sample, and examining it for the presence of pathogenic micro-organisms. If any are found they should be screened for antibiotic sensitivity and antibiotic therapy adjusted accordingly. However, immediate therapy to provide relief consists of large doses of broad-based antibiotics.
By the time the culture report is obtained more than 80% of patients will have responded to this therapy. Where response is good, it should be continued for at least a week.
Post-partum metritis can occur in domestic elephants that have otherwise had a normal delivery. To help evacuate the pus from the uterus, it is douched with a 5% potassium permanganate solution to which antibiotics are added. Parental administration of high doses of antibiotics combined with corticosteroids and other supportive therapy are essential for the successful treatment of such cases. Treatment should be carried out for at least 14 consecutive days, or until all clinical signs vanish, whichever is the longer.
A-5.10 PARASITIC AND TICK-BORNE DISEASES
Babesiosis
Animals suffering from babesiosis have a mildly elevated body temperature of about 37.8_C (100_F) _ compared with the usual 36.6_-37_C (98.0_F-98.6_F) _ loss of general condition, loss of appetite, anaemia and haemoglobaemia. Transmission is by various ticks, including Boophilus annulatus, Bunicoplus spp., Ixodes spp., Ricinus spp. and Ripicephalus spp.
Surra
This disease of elephants is caused by a blood parasite _ Trypanosoma evansi _ which is carried by biting fleas and mosquitoes. It is a wasting disease: however much the elephant eats it never puts on weight. Oedema appears in the dependent parts of the body, there is muscular weakness, and finally paralysis. The elephant has slow, lethargic movements; gets exhausted easily; and has intermittent diarrhoea and fever.
Filariasis
Filariasis, caused by the parasitic nematode Indofilaria patta biramani, is common amongst domesticated elephants. It causes a haemorrhagic dermatitis. Clinically multiple abscesses appear through the body. Blood smears are the only means of confirm the diagnosis. Anti-filarial drugs, such as diethyl carbamazine citrate administered parentally, combined with anti-histamines parentally for 2 weeks usually cures the condition. High doses of antibiotics (e.g., procaine penicillin, 6 000 000 units, and streptomycin, 8 g, should be given intravenously daily for 10 days to combat secondary infection of the multiple abscesses.
Endoparasites in general
The drug of choice in the treatment of internal parasites in elephants is the anthelmintic thiabendazole (40 mg per kg body weight). In the case of milk-feeding baby elephants, it is preferable to use piperazine citrate, 100 mg per kg during the first few months of life. It is preferable to use fractional dosing in milk-feeding baby elephants.
Ectoparasites
Ectoparasites of elephants include mange mites, ticks, and elephant louse. Clinically, with ectoparasitic infestation the entire body surface becomes irritated, with acute pruritus and inflammation. The patient is generally restless, rubbing its body on trees, which in turn causes abrasions and secondary infection sets in if proper treatment is not given. Treatment involves administration of an analgesic (e.g., promethazine hydrochloride, 500 mg parentally twice a day for 10 days), an anti-inflammatory agent (e.g., dexamethasone, 90 mg intravenously twice a day for 10 days), broad spectrum antibiotic (e.g., procaine penicillin, 6 000 000 units intramuscularly once a day for 10 days), and a commercial, organo-phosphorus-based agricultural anti-parasitic dip applied to the skin (e.g., Neguvon-Bayer, but at half the strength recommended for domestic cattle).
Certain mange mites in elephants cause severe irritation of the tail, which can become so unbearable that the elephant hits its tail against trees. This can lead to such extensive trauma that necrosis sets in and the caudal vertebrae fall off one by one, thereby shortening the tail.
Treatment involves washing the tail well, using soap and water, twice a day; cleaning the affected areas with hydrogen peroxide; administering high doses of antibiotic, such as penicillin; and anointing the tail twice daily with a mixture comprising iodoform (75 g [_3 ozs]); camphorated oil (225 g [_8 ozs]); turpentine (225 g [_8 ozs]); and an organo-phosphorus insecticide, such as Negnum-Bayer) (50 g [2 ozs]).
A-5.11 PHYSIOLOGICAL DISORDERS
Dependent oedema is a common clinical sign of a very poor physiological state. Fluid accumulates in the external genitalia, which become obviously swollen. Frusemide 600 mg given intramuscularly twice a day with other supportive therapy is helpful.
Elephants are very susceptible to heatstroke due to thermoregulatory imbalance. If exposed to high temperatures for long periods they can die of heatstroke.
Clinically, elephants suffering from heatstroke exhibit a staggering gait, rigor, depression and sudden collapse.
The animal must be immediately provided with shade. Administer hydrocortisone succinate, 600 mg, intravenously together with normal saline drips, 500 ml × 20, plus 50% dextrose, 20 ml × 20, immediately. Give chloramphenicol, 10 g, intravenously, and follow up with symptomatic treatment.
A-5.12 WORK-RELATED INJURIES
Common accidents affecting working elephants include:
_ Trunk injuries, such as crushing, foreign body penetration, lacerations, or damage to motor nerves. These occur when timber logs are being loaded, unloaded, or during tree felling. Trunk paralysis may occur in some cases due to nerve injuries. Secondary bacterial infections are a problem in trunk injuries, requiring antibiotics in high doses, corticosteroids and analgesics.
_ Tusk injuries. If the tusk breaks over the root canal, there is haemorrhage and pain, and with the danger of secondary infection leading to loss of the entire tusk. Treatment is as follows: sedation of the elephant with Chlorpromazine hydrochloride; analgesics such as Votaren (Diclofenac); and high doses of broad spectrum antibiotics. If the nerve is exposed it may lead to death of the nerve, and ultimately loss of the tusk, if not treated properly. The simplest way to minimize risk of loss of the tusk is to flush the exposed nerve with a general-purpose antiseptic, such as cetrimide, and to cover the wound with an antibiotic ointment, coupled with parenteral administration of large doses of antibiotics.
A-5.13 MISCELLANEOUS PROBLEMS
Some elephants, such as juveniles that had been rescued and brought to be admitted to the elephant orphanage, have died either of a "broken heart" or "sudden death syndrome" due to the fact that they had been transported in isolation in a lorry, and the isolation had been a terrifying experience. The "broken heart" reaction may be avoided by providing other elephants as travelling companions. This is a common experience with rescued elephants, and can be reduced if these rescued elephants are quickly brought to the orphanage and allowed to mix with the other inmates _ adults, sub-adults and babies.
In the wild state, several of a group of elephants have died instantaneously due to fear caused by thunderstorms. Actual death is caused by the continuous discharge of the sympathetic nervous system, which induces ventricular fibrillation.
