ZAMBIA: General information A. Location and Terrain Zambia is a land-locked country found in central/southern Africa, lying between Latitudes 80 and 180 South of the Equator and Longitudes 220 and 340 east of Greenwich (00) meridian. It is bordered by the Democratic Republic of Congo, Tanzania, Malawi, Mozambique, Botswana, Namibia and Angola. It has a surface area of 752,614 km2 most of which forms the highest part of the plateau lying between 1000 and 1600 meters above sea level. The highest parts of the country are in the northeast, with the plateau gradually sloping to the southwest. B. Ecology Climate and Hydrology Zambia's altitude puts it in the broad belt of temperate highlands, which moderates what would otherwise be a harsh tropical climate. The temperatures range from 160C to 270C in the cool and dry season and from 270C to 380C in the hot and wet season. These characteristics result in two major climatic extremes: the semi-arid western region and the swampy Lake Bangweulu area in the North-Eastern part of the country. The country's main drainage systems are the Zambezi River system whose major tributaries are the Kabompo, Kafue and Luangwa rivers, and the Chambeshi Watershed. These rivers together with the large lakes, provide Zambia's most important water, fisheries and tourism resources. Annual summer rainfall ranges from 500 to 1500 mm during the months of November to March, which varies with latitude and altitude. Mean annual rainfall decreases from the equator towards the tropical of Capricorn and from north and north-east to the south and south-west. Vegetation Described in main text of this report. Fish and Wildlife Fish and wildlife are some of the country's most valuable natural resources. Although land-locked, the rivers and lakes of Zambia are known to support about 156 fish species. Zambia is also renowned for the extensive area and biological richness of its wetlands. There are about 190 species of wild animals in Zambia and a large diversity of birds, reptiles and insects; for example, Zambia is known to be the only country with the rare black lechwe, a herbivore that thrives in swampy habitats. 5 Woodfuel Review and Assessment in Zambia - 1999.
C. Population The estimated population for Zambia in 1990 was 7,383,097 (1990 census). With a growth rate of 3.1% per annum, population estimates for 1995, 1996, 1997 and 1998 were 9095000, 9397000, 9712000 and 10036000 respectively. About 39.4% of the population is concentrated in urban areas, mostly on the Copperbelt and Lusaka where about two thirds of the total urban population lives; unemployment is prevalent in these areas. Other high-density areas are in the agricultural zone along the central, north-south `line of rail'. The population is thus highly clustered. However, there are vast areas which are almost unpopulated and so on average, Zambia has a very low population density. D. Land-Use Agriculture Zambia's agriculture is characterised by a distinct contrast between commercial and subsistence farming. Large-scale commercial farms are concentrated along the central `line of rail', while subsistence farming is distributed throughout the country. The level of mechanisation is low and use of animal draft power is still to develop fully. In the commercial sector, however, a high level of inputs characterises production. Farming in Zambia is predominantly rain-fed with only about 1% of the potential agricultural land being irrigated. Maize is the main food and cash crop, followed by sorghum and cassava. Livestock Cattle production is limited by poor grazing land and high incidence of disease. Most of the cattle is under traditional herders and cattle are concentrated in the upper Zambezi and middle Kafue areas and the Eastern Province. Overstocking on grazing lands has resulted in bush encroachment and severe soil erosion in certain areas. National Parks Nineteen National Parks (covering 8% of the country) and thirty one Game Management Areas (covering 24% of the country) have been set aside to conserve representative wildlife and ecological units. E. Minerals Zambia's most important mineral is copper. The country has about 6% of the world's proven copper reserves and ranks fifth in production. Zambia also produces cobalt, ranking second in world production (1990). Other minerals include lead and zinc, gold, silver, iron ore and uranium, most of them being produced in marginal quantities. Coal is also mined to a limited extent.

Discussed in main text. G. Economy Zambia's current economy is driven by the private sector, which has shares in major industries around the country. The major export commodities include copper, cobalt, tobacco, flowers, and many other commodities, which contribute about 12% of, total exports. The GDP at 1998 prices (ZK'Billion) was estimated to be 5921.1 and GDP per capital (ZK'000) at 234.1. GDP growth rate for 1998 was -1.97 and National Income (ZK'Billion) was 5612.0. Per capital monthly inflation rates for September, October, November and December 1998 were 1.4, 2.1, 1.5 and 5.6 respectively Total Labour force for 1998 was 4,712,000 and formal sector employment stood at 465,000. The informal sector employment figures recorded in 1996 were 2,482,387. The poverty status (figures for 1996) were extremely poor (66%), moderately poor (12%) and non-poor (22%). The current economic policy provides for a conducive environment for private sector investment in any business industry, including those that are forestry based. H. Political Zambia is a multiparty democracy country with about 34 registered political parties. The major parties include the ruling Movement for Multiparty democracy (MMD), United National Independent Party (UNIP), United Party for National development (UPND) and the United Democratic Alliance. The Movement for Multiparty Democracy (MMD) enjoys the majority vote in parliament, having about 118 Seats out of a total of 150. The other seats are shared by the opposition and independents. The political climate is such that any one that enjoys popularity and is a Zambian, can form and register a political party. I. General.
On the social scene, Zambia is best known for its foot-balling (Soccer) prowess on the regional and continental levels. The diverse of culture and ceremonies in various traditional settings, ads flavour to the tourism industry and entertainment sector. Of the total 73 tribal groupings, 7 are recognised to be prominent and are aired on both Radio and TV of the Zambia National Broadcasting Corporation (ZNBC). There are also a number of relic sites, many of which are national monuments and are therefore, protected from any form of defacing of annihilation. 7 Woodfuel Review and Assessment in Zambia - 1999.
INTRODUCTION.
This paper looks at the woodfuel situation in Zambia as recorded in the past five-(5) years in the context of production, supply, demand/consumption and trade. Perhaps before going into the details of this study paper, it would be important to give a preamble to forestry development in Zambia over the last three decades. Up to the time that Zambia attained political independence and shortly thereafter, it was endowed with an abundant forest resource base. However, with the declining economic situation, increasing population levels and other negative developments of the last three decades, the forest ecosystem has been greatly impoverished. Such developments resulted in escalating rates of deforestation and coupled with the inadequacy of the Forest Policy (up to 1998), were cited as the major contributing factors to the degradation of the forest ecosystem. While acknowledgement may be made of the fact that between 65% and 70% of Zambia's land area is under one form of forest cover or another, evidence of continuing deforestation resulting in various negative factors is so obvious. It was based upon such trends that the Zambian Government, through the MENR, felt compelled in 1994 to institute appropriate measures, not only to invigorate the integrity of the Forest Estate, but also to provide for a viable policy and legal framework to attract investments, create responsive corporate/public enterprises, redefine forest land ownership and attract meaningful commitment from a variety of stakeholders to tree growing, protection and utilisation of forest products. The ZFAP was, therefore, formulated and instituted in 1995 to provide a ministerial framework for the rational management and conservation of Zambia's forest resources and the enhancement of the forestry sector's contribution to socio-economic development, poverty alleviation, improved food security and environmental protection of the country (Zambia). The ZFAP was Zambia's national response to the aspirations of the FAO initiated TFAP. The Programme undertook to identify key forest sector issues and opportunities available to resolve them and therefore, enhancing national capacity to formulate, implement and monitor a comprehensive participatory forest sector program. The ZFAP, therefore, ushered in a number of coherent changes, which included formulation of the PFAP and redesigning of the Forest Policy and Legislative frameworks. The PFAP undertook to facilitate the formulation of three participatory forest management plans for Central, Copperbelt and Luapula Provinces. The PFAP is an integral part of the ZFAP process and aimed at supporting and improving the ZFAP process by strengthening institutions involved in the forestry sector. The PFAP also aimed at increasing both direct and indirect benefits from forests and trees to citizens of the three Provinces through greater involvement of forest dependent communities and 8 Woodfuel Review and Assessment in Zambia - 1999.
resource users, while increasing the revenues accruing to the Government from the forestry sector. The implementation of the first phase of the PFAP lasted from August 1995 to December 1998. Various studies instituted and data collected under the ZFAP (1995 - 1997) revealed how inadequate the old Forest Policy was and how it negatively affected forestry's contribution to the national economy. Features like the Forestry Department being the solely responsible government enterprise in forest production and the negative effects thereof were greatly exposed. The old Forestry Policy proved inadequate due to the narrow context within which the forestry sector operated. The potential contribution of the Forest Estate was neither fully assessed nor attained under the existing circumstances and provisions of the policy. The policy gave explicit and implicit powers to the Forestry Department as the largest and most formidable estate agent and manager in the country. The Department enjoyed unchallenged monopoly to grow trees, determine where and when to harvest forest produce, fix, and revise prices of forest products and services. The policy was, therefore, oblivious of the important roles that local communities could play and was completely silent on gender issues. Such circumstances greatly eroded the possibility of a common forestry goal between the Forestry Department and the citizenry at large. Hence, instead of fostering co-operation and participation of traditional rulers and local communities, the policy intuitively engendered frustration and outright conflict. Evidently, from the above presentation, the need to launch a new policy with dynamic elements for effective participation of all stakeholders was cultivated. The first draft copy of the policy was produced in March 1997 and has since been approved and published in booklet form. The ZFAP also initiated changes to the Forest Law, which led to the drafting of a new Forestry Bill. The Bill is now before parliament and when enacted will usher in the Zambia Forestry Commission that will take over the responsibilities of the Forestry Department. A number of studies were thus conducted during the ZFAP and PFAP phases, to gather baseline data that was later compounded on some of the above concerns. Working papers have since been documented. However, the coverage of the studies was narrow due to the limited time frames and spheres of operation of the ZFAP and PFAP processes. Nevertheless, since the two processes are on-going, this paper has tried to outline some findings of the published papers and has attempted to make other pertinent suggestions on the sustainable management and utilisation of forest resources, based on the prevailing national, sub nation (regional) and local level woodfuel production, demand and/or consumption, supply and trade. The paper is not exhaustive in itself, but suggests a wider scope and framework within which Government Forestry Policy should proceed if the `dream' of meeting the energy requirements in Zambia is to be realised. This paper will therefore be tailored in presentation, to the aspirations of the new policy and those of the National Energy Policy of 1994 that prominently featured woodfuel as the first energy sub-sector recognised. The new Forestry Policy was engineered in such a 9 Woodfuel Review and Assessment in Zambia - 1999.
manner that it touched on the main tenets of the Energy Policy concerning sustainable woodfuel consumption. The broad elements of the Energy Policy which pertain to woodfuel production and its implications on the forestry sector are here-under restated: To ensure the management and sustainability of forest resources for woodfuel harvesting To improve the technology of charcoal production and utilisation To improve revenue collection from woodfuel industry To support efforts aimed at finding alternatives to woodfuel in order to achieve higher living standards.
It should also be noted that most figures and/or statistics presented in this paper may vary slightly because of the narrow sampling intensities and non comprehensive nature of most studies conducted, which were mostly locally and/or regionally based and only extrapolated to the national scale. In addition, empirical studies may present variations in precision for different survey localities and timeframes. Nevertheless, the statistics and information presented do give a direction for decision making and planning for sustainable woodfuel production, supply, demand/consumption and trade in Zambia.
WOODFUEL PRODUCTION.
From around the late 1980s, there have been no defined forest management prescriptions that are practically being implemented for woodfuel production. On paper, however, a number of management prescriptions have been suggested that are envisaged to increase productivity of both forests and woodlands in provision of products and services on a sustainable basis. To have a comprehensive understanding of woodfuel production, this paper will define production systems to mean forest ecosystem types and their management for the production of biomass and/or biodiversity for provision of forest products and in this context woodfuel. The definition will go further to imply the various conversion methods used to transform trees into woodfuel and harvesting systems used. This section on production will borrow heavily from studies conducted in the miombo woodlands (which cover between 55% and 60% of total land area) by Professor E. N. Chidumayo and A. Marjokorpi (1996 - 97), M. Grunder (1995), P. L. W. Chitondo (1997) and the Forestry Department (1995 - 1999).
Vegetation Types Ecosystem nomenclature in Zambia is based on vegetation types and Chidumayo and Marjokorpi (1997) have identified five forest types (Dry evergreen, Dry deciduous, Montane, Swamp and Riparian), five woodland types (Miombo, Kalahari, Mopane, 10 Woodfuel Review and Assessment in Zambia - 1999.
Munga and Termitaria) and Grasslands. In addition to the natural vegetation types, plantation forests of tropical pines and eucalyptus covering about 61,000 ha. have been established countrywide, with over 80% of these occurring on the Copperbelt Province. About 50,000 ha. of industrial plantations are found on the Copperbelt of which about 80% are pine and 20% eucalyptus. These are currently managed by a parastatal company, ZAFFICO Ltd. About 7,000 ha. of Local and Regional supply plantations in the Provinces are managed by the Forestry Department. The rest are plantations and woodlots managed by individuals at the semi-commercial and farm levels. Dry evergreen forests occur in the high rainfall zone with over 1100mm, on deep freely draining soils with adequate underground water. The dominant genera are Marquesia, Parinari and Cryptosepalum. Dry deciduous is a low rainfall (600 - 900mm) vegetation type on deep and usually sand soils which remain moist at depth during a greater part of the dry season. Dominant genera are Baikiaea and Guibourtia. The forest type covers parts of Western and Southern Provinces. Swamp and Riparian forests occur in the high rainfall zones of North-Western, Luapula and Northern Provinces and parts of the Copperbelt Province. Swamp forests are characterised by dominant trees, which have buttresses and stilt roots to give stability on damp ground. Swamp and Riparian forests are also common at stream heads, streamsides, river estuaries and on wide flats besides rivers and lakes. Dominant genera are Ilex, Mitragyna and Syzygium. Miombo woodland is the most extensive vegetation type in Zambia and is estimated to cover about 55% of the total land area and is dominated by tree species of Brachystegia, Julbernardia and Isoberlinia, which are very good woodfuel species. Soils are generally poor, shallow and slightly acidic, having quartz rubble or laterite underneath. Kalahari woodland is a variant of miombo woodland that grows on Kalahari sand and is widespread on the sands of Western Province and of the western half of North-Western Province. Mopane woodland occurs on alkaline soils of Central and parts of Lusaka Provinces. It is also found mixed with Miombo at the bottom of escarpments and with Munga woodland at dambo edges. The dominant and characteristic species is Colophospermum mopane. Munga woodland is a park-like woodland with trees scattered or in groups. The dominant species are Acacia, Combretum and Terminalia and this vegetation type covers the greater part of Central and Southern Zambia. One prominent characteristic feature is presence of dense tall grass, flat ground and rich clayey soils. Lake basin Chipya is a vegetation type that probably resulted from the destruction, usually by fire, of Parinari and Marquesia forests. It is three-storied with an open, evergreen or deciduous top canopy up to 25m, a broken understorey 6-12m and a 2-3m 11 Woodfuel Review and Assessment in Zambia - 1999.
shrub layer. It occurs over an extensive area of Northern and Luapula Provinces around Lakes Bangweulu and Mweru and in the Chambeshi and Luapula valleys. The soils are pale, sandy and very acidic. It also occurs on the Copperbelt where it is called Copperbelt Chipya. Kalahari sand Chipya is assumed to have been derived from Dry Evergreen forests that were destroyed by fire. It is open and composed of fire hardy species. Anthill (Termitaria woodland) is a Savannah vegetation that is dominant in the transition between wetlands, grasslands and plateau forest or woodland. It has tree groves or termite mounds and grasslands on low ground. This woodland supports a community of plants, which is usually very different from surrounding forest or woodland. This is due to such factors as raised elevation, higher clay and mineral content of the soil, high pH, higher moisture content of the soil and a greater biological activity. Species of Boscia, Strychnos, Diospyros and Sterculia are common. Grasslands are either edaphic or secondary and cover dambos, flood plains and margins of pans, swamps and lakes. They are found also in all land that is naturally without trees and in places with a permanently high water table. The dominant grasses belong to the genera Acroceras, Leersia, Oryza, Panicum, Paspalum, Sacciolepsis and Vossia. Open areas outside conservation areas (i.e. Forest Reserves, National Parks and Game Management Areas) contain the highest proportion of each vegetation type. In fact, Swamp and Riparian forests are not represented in conservation areas. Plantation forests and Miombo woodlands are well represented in Forest Reserves as are Deciduous forests, Miombo, Kalahari and Termitaria in National Parks, while Kalahari, Mopane, Munga and Termitaria woodlands are well represented in Game Management Areas. The Total area under forest cover in Zambia is estimated to be 44.6 million hectares, out of which Savannah woodlands account for about 71% of the total land area. Savannah woodlands are dominated by the Miombo, which covers between 41.2% and 55% of the country's total area (Forestry Department, 1999). In relative terms, the Forestry Department (1999) estimates the vegetation cover to be distributed as follows: -Savannah woodlands -Closed forests -Grasslands 65.49% 5.37% 29.04%.
Within climatic limitations, composition and character of vegetation is governed by soil and drainage conditions which in turn are related to geomorphology (Chidumayo, 1997). Both biotic and edaphic factors affect the dynamics of vegetation. The majority of indigenous trees and shrubs have a high potential to regenerate from seed, stumps and roots. However, regeneration can be adversely affected by over-browsing and 12 Woodfuel Review and Assessment in Zambia - 1999.
uncontrolled late forest fires. Repeated browsing results in preferred species being depleted, while frequent late dry season fires eliminate fire tender species, thereby preventing adequate forest regeneration. Consequently, use of fire in shifting cultivation has resulted in widespread destruction of original tree cover in Zambia and its replacement by secondary vegetation. The fact that Miombo woodlands regenerate unchanged after clearing, Chidumayo and Marjokorpi (1997) considered that Miombo woodland is mostly regrowth of variable ages as a result of fire, cultivation and exploitation. In contrast, Chipya forest, in which firetolerant species dominate over a tall herbaceous layer, represents a regressive stage after destruction of Dry Evergreen forest. Apparently, reversion to Dry evergreen forest is possible with protection from fire. Of the total land area in Zambia, about 9.9% are gazetted Forest Reserves. Out of this Forest Estate area, 44% is set aside for Production, 30% for both production and protection, while the remaining 26% is specifically for protection (ZFAP, 1997).

Source: ZFAP, 1997 It is, however, unfortunate that no comprehensive forest inventories have been conducted in the last three decades. The 1984 - 86 Survey was only undertaken in a few locations and existing yield estimates are essentially based on assumptions of changes that have taken place during the last 30 years. This Survey estimated growing stock to vary from 40 to 154 m3/ha. by Province (ZFAP, 1997). Table 2.2: Estimation of standing stock in 1996; FR = Forest Reserve Forests in open areas.

Plant Productivity Chidumayo (1997) has stated that plant productivity in the Miombo woodland primarily depends on:.
2. Soil moisture; and Soil available nutrients.
Rainfall is seasonal and availability of soil nutrients is low. Consequently, productivity is low. Grunder (1995) suggests that vegetation cover intercepts rain drops and reduces its dislodging capacity to the soil. He also notes that vegetation cover increases, through litter fall, the organic matter content of the soil, which plays an important role in making nutrients available and in particular, increases the soil water retention capacity. These factors support plant production and clearly show that good management of vegetation 14 Woodfuel Review and Assessment in Zambia - 1999.
cover is important for the sustainable and increased production of woody and agricultural products. Forests with closed canopy (and therefore optimal protection) are limited in extent in Zambia and cover only 6.5% of the total land area. Woodlands, with a reduced cover on the other hand, account for about 70% of the total land area (Grunder, 1995). Chidumayo (1997), recognises two main aspects to Miombo woodland management for increasing plant productivity:.
2. Sustainable utilisation of products Sustainable regeneration of products and services.
Sustainable Utilisation Chitondo (1997) has suggested the following measures for the sustainable utilisation of Miombo woodlands: --Instituting clear felling or coppice harvesting systems as the most appropriate for charcoal production. Under such an arrangement, forest areas are divided into coupes which are laid out in blocks of five (5), with each block measuring 100m wide and the sixth being 110m wide and left uncut as a protection belt. This gives a beacon every 610m. Protection belts are also left at every end of coupes. Coupes have been found to be most applicable in areas that have been selectively thinned for sawlogs, in which merchantable commercial timber species have been removed. However, the system is at the moment just on paper and is not practised by charcoal burners. Woodfuel Conversion and Utilisation Nkomeshya (1997) has listed the following tree species for firewood production: *Julbernardia paniculata (Mutondo, B) *Julbernardia globiflora (Sandwe, B) *Brachystegia boehmii (Musamba, B) *Brachystegia spiciformis (Muputu, B) *Bauhinia thoningii (Musekese, B) *Pericopsis angolensis (Mubanga, B) *Parinari curatellifolia (Mupundu, B) *Uapaca kirkiana (Musuku, B) B = Bemba Language The above tree species are preferred because of their high heat content value and that they last long in burning. Based on the same principle of heat value and durability in burning, 15 Woodfuel Review and Assessment in Zambia - 1999.
preferred charcoal tree species are not so different from those used for firewood. Selectivity in woodfuel tree species has resulted in localised scarcities of the preferred species. However, due to continuously increasing demand for woodfuel and depletion of priority species, current-harvesting methods do not segregate on species and this situation has culminated in complete degradation of certain forest areas. Natural regeneration in these areas has become almost impossible (under current institutional arrangements and economic situation) because regrowths are rarely given a chance to develop into mature trees - some are cut immediately they start to show signs of stem rigidity and others are destroyed by late fires which are very common, especially in livestock areas and in areas under the slash and burn (Chitemene) system of agriculture. Zambian charcoal and firewood are estimated to have heat content values of 32.60 and 15.50GJ/tonne respectively (Department of Energy, 1992). Charcoal is, therefore, the most preferred of the two by most urban markets because of its superior qualities over firewood e.g. cleaner combustion, easy transportation and handling and high heat value. Rural communities on the other hand prefer firewood because they can not compete for charcoal with urban customers whose high demand leads to increased prices which the income `stripped' rural dwellers can not afford. Lack of alternative income generating ventures further alienates rural dwellers from use of charcoal because even those who are able to produce the commodity, would rather offer it for sale to fill the income gap and use firewood for their energy requirements. The major problem that has been associated with charcoal production, however, is in the way it is produced and the kind of losses incurred in its production. The earth kilns used are mostly 10% efficient, implying that in the process of producing charcoal from wood, 90% by weight is lost. From 100 tonnes of wood, therefore, one only expects to get 10 tonnes of charcoal (Kapiyo, 1996). The charcoal production process should therefore be done in efficient kilns or better still, wood should be burnt directly without first transforming it into charcoal. This will serve to sustain the current available, but highly endangered wood stocks. Promotion of alternative and renewable energy sources should be intensified and implemented. Sustainable Regeneration Chidumayo (1997) states that natural regeneration of forests is through seed, stumps (coppices) and roots. He further states that there are five (5) factors that affect natural regeneration:.
Canopy shading in selective felling systems; Inter-shoot competition, whereby only the dominant shoots contribute to the next generation; Capacity to regenerate (coppice) decreases with age and stem size; Late forest fires which kill seedlings and coppices; Cutting of seed bearers for woodfuel and sawlogs and clearing for agriculture. Seed bearers are usually cut because of their bigger diameters and hence are preferred for timber as sawlogs. This contributes to poor regeneration from seed. 16 Woodfuel Review and Assessment in Zambia - 1999.
The average establishment period for natural regeneration has been calculated at 8 years for both seedlings and coppices, but this varies between 2 and 11 years depending on species. Normal establishment period for new crop is best regarded at 10 years when stool mortality and different sources of regeneration are taken into account (Chitondo, 1997). The cutting cycle in selective cutting areas is 20 years and 60 years in clear-felled areas. 100 years are regarded as the period needed for a tree in a Miombo woodland, under natural conditions, to attain DBH of 30cm. Silvicultural treatments have proved to reduce this period to 60 years on average quality sites and 50 years on best quality sites (Chitondo, 1997). Chitondo (1997) has also indicated that stumps of almost all Miombo species have the ability to coppice. Many shoots may be produced on one stump, but this reduces due to inter-shoot competition and therefore, as stated earlier in this paper, only dominant shoots contribute to the next generation. On stumps for valuable species, singling may be applied to leave only one dominant shoot. However, stump trimming is rarely done and hence the rate of stump rot is high and regeneration through stumps is reduced. This problem has also been compounded by inadequate supervision and control by the Forestry Department. Root or vegetative regeneration is most prevalent in stumped, uprooted and machinerylogged areas. Unless damaged by fire, such regeneration produces straight poles in the medium-term and timber in the long-term. In recent times, such poles have been used for firewood in wood deficit areas. Artificial regeneration has been used to ensure complete regeneration in areas where no seed trees exist or where they are widely scattered. Chitondo (1997) has identified the following as the main failures in the implementation of natural regeneration:.
4. Institutional failures by the Forestry Department to supervise felling; Lack of training for loggers; Death of suckers from late forest fires as a result of lack of early burning; Seed bearing trees are not reserved.
Artificial regeneration is also not practised in natural forests and cutting cycles are not followed due to non-existent of management plans. Chidumayo (1997), has gone further to suggest that the provision of wood products by the Miombo woodland is limited by:.
2. Productivity; and Quality of the wood resource.
Wood production is also affected by the response of miombo trees to harvesting. The response depends on: 17 Woodfuel Review and Assessment in Zambia - 1999.
*Phenological state of trees at the time of harvesting; *Degree of tolerance to fire; *Ability to resprout; *Seeding patterns; *Seed germination characteristics; *Seed development; and *Tree growth rate. In addition to the above factors, Chidumayo (1997) also states that the rate of regeneration in the miombo woodlands is affected by human activities. To further enhance the productivity and quality of the wood resource, the following arguments have been proposed: That since tree regeneration in the miombo is through seed and/or vegetative regrowth and because tree seedlings possess the following characteristics: *Slow initial growth during root development and growth (up to 15 years); *Shade induced growth suppression during post root development and growth (indefinite period), Seeds produced immediately before woodland clearing do not contribute to the succeeding regrowth stand. Seedlings and/or suppressed saplings accumulate in the herb layer over time and consequently predominate the woody plant population in old growth miombo. The majority of miombo trees will respond to cutting by resprouting and within a stand or species class, resprouting will depend on: *Vigour of dormant buds and/or the bark thickness which are also related to the age/size of a tree; *Phenological or health status of a tree at the time of cutting; *Health status of a stump after cutting. Because the tree density increases with each succeeding generation of regrowth, the contribution of stump coppice to regeneration increases with each succeeding regrowth miombo. The tree cutting height has also been found to affect the nature and rate of regeneration and the quality of wood products e.g. pollarding, stumping and uprooting will all lead to regeneration with specific wood qualities. The time of cutting affects wood production, especially during the first year after cutting, depending on the phenological phase in which a tree is at during the time of cutting.

Source: Chidumayo, 1997 Cutting down trees after stored resources have been used during leaf flush reduces growth during the first growing season and the duration of the growing season is reduced. Fires also affect the active regeneration of miombo woodlands depending on: *Size/height of stem; *Species tolerance to fire; *Fuel biomass/fire intensity; *Time of burning - early or late in the dry season; *Phenological phase at the time of burning (before or after leaf flush); *Bark thickness; *Wood moisture content; and *Capacity to resprout after damage by fire. Generally, fires that occur in miombo woodlands reduce stem density, productivity and annual biomass increment and the quality of poles. Fierce and damaging fires occur late in the dry season, especially after leaf flush due to high leaf biomass. Tree species that flush early are, therefore, more susceptible to fire damage. Early burning has consequently been suggested to be less destructive, but in recently cutover areas, as Chidumayo (1997) states, the amount of wood debris, if not removed, is usually very high and in such instances, even an early burning exercise would be fierce and damaging to young coppices. Under such conditions, complete fire protection may be necessary to promote forest production, but is not practical because of:.
2. The high risk of destructive accidental fires due to the building up of fuel biomass Cultural applications of fire by communities inhabiting miombo woodlands.
Fire management in miombo woodlands should therefore take into account:.
The age of the woodland; Size of stems; Phenology of dominant and/or desirable species; Type of land use; Management objectives of an area (especially forest production versus grazing).

CONSUMPTION, DEMAND AND SUPPLY OF WOODFUEL.
The major consumer group of forest resources are households and the industrial sector. About 88% of households depend on forest resources to meet their basic energy needs. About 19.4 million m3 were, therefore, estimated to be the woodfuel consumed in 1996 (ZFAP, 1997). Industrial wood consumption (including sawlogs, transmission and fencing poles) was estimated at 3.1 million m3 during the same year. Kalumiana (1997) reports that woodfuel is the largest source of energy in Zambia, followed by petroleum, electricity and coal. Over 90% of Zambia's electricity supply is hydropower whose potential capacity is estimated at 6,000 MW, while installed capacity is 1,632 MW. Proven coal reserves amount to 30 million tonnes (Kalumiana, 1997). Zambia's mean solar insulation is 4 KWh m-2/day, while mean wind speed is 2.5 ms-1. National total annual production of animal dung (available for biogas production) is estimated at 759,000 tonnes (Kalumiana, 1997). Overall, total energy consumption in Zambia exceeds 4.5 million Tonnes of Oil Equivalent (TOE) per annum, with each fuel's contribution being as follows: Woodfuel Petroleum Products Electricity Coal (Kalumiana, 1997). Studies conducted during the ZFAP planning phase exhibit three interesting situations: **The first relates to the present small wood surplus from different production sources; a situation which may be unsustainable beyond the year 2000.

Source: ZFAP, 1997 **The second situation is that on the Provincial basis; four (4) Provinces (Copperbelt, Eastern, Lusaka and Southern) are already experiencing wood deficits and soon after the year 2000, only Northern, N/Western and Western Provinces would be barely self-sufficient in wood products.

**The third scenario is expected to result from various ZFAP interventions which are envisaged, such as those directed at improved forest management and fire control as well as those intended to halt wood waste at exploitation sites through processing and marketing stages. While nationally there might be a surplus of wood products, there will still be regional deficits as depicted in Table 3.3 above. Chitondo (1997) estimates that about 0.7% to 1.0% of forest area is lost annually through deforestation resulting from agricultural expansion and charcoal production. Evidence of increased wood fuel demands and land degradation can be verified by encroachment and charcoal production even in protected forest areas, a situation which is indicative of high consumption patterns and diminishing local wood stock supplies in open and production forest areas. Worse still, even botanical reserves have been encroached and charcoal production kilns and rampant deforestation are so obvious. Such trends are common in forest areas close to urbanised and highly populated cities and town centres. Riverbanks have been cleared of trees to pave way for agriculture and the trees cut are used for woodfuel production. Environmental problems are, therefore escalating daily and in densely populated regions, supply and demand of forest products are foreseen to be increasingly unbalanced (Forestry Department, 1996). National Woodfuel Consumption Patterns Rural communities are completely dependent on fuelwood for cooking and heating. Latest information states that household energy supply in urban centres is also predominantly based on Charcoal. In three of the PFAP Pilot Provinces, estimates indicate figures of 150,000 ha. as areas harvested for charcoal production (PFAP, 1997). Out of the 38 Forest Reserves in Central Province, the most encroached and/or depleted were found in Chibombo District, mainly due to charcoal production (Nkomeshya, 1997). This gives an indication of high charcoal demand and/or consumption and also reflects that the predominant land use system is charcoal production in forests near to urban centres. Most of the charcoal produced in Chibombo District is taken to the Lusaka market where the commodity fetches a good price because of high demand and consumption. This is also a `syndrome' facing many rural communities in Zambia, whereby demand is not necessary from within, but from nearby highly populated town and city centres. The high demand for woodfuel has resulted in non-species selective cutting regimes being applied by many woodfuel producers, culminating in severe depletion of many forest ecosystems and the resultant land degradation. Since rural communities can now neither find productive land nor meet the costs for agricultural inputs, the implied situation is one that perpetuates forest destruction irrespective of tree size, species and/or quality. 22 Woodfuel Review and Assessment in Zambia - 1999.
Other reports published by the Forestry Department have indicated that charcoal is the single most depleting agent of forest resources due to the continuous nature of its operations, which run throughout the year. . Current rates of harvesting are, therefore, very high, but against a poor monitoring and control system. On average, 2.5 - 3.5 kg of woodfuel are used per household per day in rural areas. This consumption when extrapolated to annual figures and in segregating between charcoal and firewood, amounts to not less than 72.76 kg per person per annum and 1025.37 kg per person per annum for charcoal and firewood respectively (Forestry Department, 1999). The number of persons per household, type of food cooked, number of times of cooking and different tasks performed (water boiling, house warming, manner of caring for the fire, type of devices, distance to firewood fetching points and fuel mix (i.e. charcoal plus electricity, etc.) contribute in determining the quantities of woodfuel required per household at a particular time. Urban households are estimated to consume about 240 kg per person per annum of firewood and 139.6 kg and 131.0 kg per person per annum of charcoal for small and big urban centres respectively (Forestry Department, 1999). Such figures correlate with a study conducted in Kenya where a village of 5,000 people consumed about 12 - 18 tonnes of woodfuel per day. This survey also showed consumption of 15 - 20 kg per household of six (6) persons per day (Kapiyo, 1996). However, consumption patterns are also affected by quantities of wood stock in surrounding areas or forests. Communities living close to and/or around well-stocked forests tend to have a steady supply of woodfuel and can afford to meet their daily requirements for woodfuel energy. On the other hand, communities depleted of wood stock will either do with whatever is available, or have to import woodfuel from other areas at inflated prices. The former is related to the Zambian situation in most rural areas, while the later is typical of urbanised areas. However, empirical observations have in recent times shown that even rural areas are now running out of wood stocks at a faster rate due to bad agricultural practices and charcoal production to supply urban centres. In rural set-ups also, institutions such as Boarding Schools, Prisons, Hospitals, Kiosks and motels have continued to depend on woodfuel and hence, where they occur, have a bearing on the demand, consumption and supply patterns of woodfuel. The unfortunate situation is that all-current increases in demand, consumption and supply do not favour regeneration/production and, therefore, most often than not, wood stocks are harvested without any due regard to the sustenance of the production base. People are more interested in meeting their daily requirements for woodfuel than the eminent consequences of continued harvesting without regeneration. Marjokorpi et al (1997) have outlined that annual consumption of woodfuel vary geographically, but they estimated that about 1.0m3 are used per household. Apparently, though small, this consumption level was found to have some significant impacts on preferred species. 23 Woodfuel Review and Assessment in Zambia - 1999.
In a survey conducted in the PFAP Provinces of Central, Copperbelt and Luapula, it was discovered that relatively large amounts of wood biomass are used for energy, in form of firewood and charcoal. Consumption of charcoal and firewood was found to vary, not only among different localities, but also between urban and rural areas. Annual consumption per household was estimated at about 8.0 tonnes of wood equivalent (Marjokorpi et al, 1997). Settlements in wetlands (in PFAP areas) use wood from surrounding forests for drying fish. In areas with underdeveloped agricultural practices, inhabitants use fish as a major source of food and income, leading to higher consumption of wood for fish drying (Marjokorpi et al, 1997). In the PFAP area, approximately 45% of the population live in urban centres in Central and Copperbelt Provinces (Marjokorpi et al, 1997). Over exploitation of forests has been concentrated on the surrounding of these urban areas, where excessive cutting for woodfuel has already led to increased degradation of woodlands. Due to increased demand and pressure on forest resources, the harvesting cycles have been shortened and late fires have become more frequent as people strive to earn a living. This has in most areas resulted in changes in species composition and the situation now threatens the active regeneration of forests and the threshold to convert forests to agricultural land has immensely declined. Supply of woodfuel is mostly from indigenous forests except in areas where plantations have been established, in which case the local people collect firewood from the plantation logging wastes. Collection of firewood, however, depends on the scarcity of indigenous wood stocks that are preferred to exotic species and on the availability of plantations within a specific locality. Collection of firewood from exotic plantations is, therefore, typical of highly populated areas where exotic pine and eucalyptus plantations have been established such as along the line of rail (both TAZARA and ZR) and in almost all District centres where the Forestry Department exists. However, access to firewood in these areas is only permitted where logging operations are taking place and/or where people prefer to buy wood in terms of poles, but later use these poles as firewood.
Demand/Consumption and Supply in Selected Study Areas.
Luapula Province Charcoal, firewood, kerosene and electricity are the main household fuels used in Luapula Province. While all the four are prominent in urban areas, electricity is not common in rural areas (Kalumiana, 1996). The total woodfuel consumption in 1996 was estimated at 98,805.5 and 353,097.2 tonnes of charcoal and firewood respectively. Out of the total firewood consumed, 5,539 tonnes were estimated to be used for fish smoking annually, representing 1.6% of total consumption. Urban households consumed 14.6% of total charcoal and 3.3% of firewood 24 Woodfuel Review and Assessment in Zambia - 1999.
consumed in the Province. Consumption figures for rural households were found to be 85.4% and 96.7% for charcoal and firewood respectively. Estimates for the year 2000 put total woodfuel consumption figures at 110,012 and 477,565 tonnes of charcoal and firewood respectively (Kalumiana, 1996). Most charcoal production is done in areas under preparation for growing crops, mostly during the months of August to November. The survey by Kalumiana (1996) revealed that there was very little charcoal production in Forest Reserves. Charcoal transportation was found to be by use of bicycles, which were well suited to the subsistence level of the charcoal industry. Most of the rural households were found mainly dependent on charcoal between the months of November to April/June/July. Firewood was prominent during the months of May to October (Kalumiana, 1996). The survey (Kalumiana, 1996) revealed that charcoal is used for cooking, water heating, space heating/warming and ironing. For electrified households, cooking and water heating were the main end-uses. Major end-uses for firewood were cooking and water heating and the immediate alternative energy source for firewood consumers was found to be charcoal. The electricity option was not feasible at the time of survey due to the high cost of electrical equipment. Solar water heaters, costing ZK600,000 (US $480) per unit were found to be beyond the reach of most households (Kalumiana, 1996). Although Kerosene was widely used by un-electrified households, its main end-use was lighting. The main end-uses for electricity were cooking and lighting. Few electricity consumers, especially those in small towns, used electricity for water heating. Most households not using electricity for cooking or water heating either had no equipment (or equipment broke down) or regarded use of electricity for such end-uses as being more expensive than charcoal (Kalumiana, 1996). Energy Consumption Patterns For the purposes of this working paper, Mansa District will be used to study the energy consumption patterns in Luapula Province because of its representative nature in terms of urban and rural standards of living. Urban Households: Among the 296 households enumerated (comprising 108, 124 and 84 households in the low, medium and high cost areas respectively), it was found that proportions of households using the four main urban fuels were as follows: charcoal, 92.9%; firewood, 24.3%; kerosene, 44.9%; electricity, 74.4%. Assessment of end-uses showed that the majority of those using charcoal used it for cooking, water heating (mainly for bathing), space heating and ironing. The major end-use, however, was cooking. The major use for firewood was water heating and for the 58 sample households, 83.3% of them used firewood for the purpose (Kalumiana, 1996).
25 Woodfuel Review and Assessment in Zambia - 1999.
Kerosene was mainly used for lighting, with only 16.5% of its consumers using it for cooking. Major end-uses for electricity, in order of decreasing importance were lighting (100%), cooking (79.3%), ironing (72.4%) and space heating (41.8%). Only 10.3% of electricity consumers used it for water heating (Kalumiana, 1996). Out of the 296 households enumerated, 258 (100 each in low and medium cost areas and 58 in high cost areas respectively) were using charcoal. Annual per capita consumption for each category was as follows: 151.24 kg for low cost, 138.39 kg for medium cost and 121.79 kg for high cost residential areas respectively. Using the 1990 proportions of households in each residential category, Kalumiana (1996) estimated that by the end of 1996, the total urban household charcoal consumption would be 6,131 tonnes for the District. When the 258 charcoal consumer households were assessed for fuel end-use, it was found that all used charcoal for cooking and 79.3%, 64.7% and 44.7% used it for water heating, space heating and ironing respectively. Only 6.5% used charcoal for baking scones, while 0.4% used it for brewing Munkoyo1 and beer. Only 58 out of the 296 enumerated households were found using firewood. Per capita annual consumption was estimated to be 246.68 kg. The Total urban household firewood consumption for 1996 was estimated at 3,488 tonnes. The majority (91.7%) of households used firewood for water heating, while less than 10% used it for other purposes. Rural Households: All households enumerated were found to be using firewood for various end-uses. Charcoal was only used on very few occasions. The charcoal used by the producers at home was mainly leftovers after packaging for sale had been done. In addition, households closer to urban centres were found to be using more charcoal than those far off. All households enumerated used kerosene for lighting (Kalumiana, 1996). Per capita charcoal consumption for rural households in Mansa was assumed to be the same as for the sample households, being 95.45 kg per annum. It was also assumed that only 155 of the population used charcoal (Kalumiana, 1996). Since only one sample area was assessed for firewood consumption, the mean consumption figure for Samfya District was used to estimate total firewood consumption. The figure was 1025.34 kg/person/annum. Charcoal and firewood consumption in 1996 were, therefore, estimated at 1,748.5 and 125,225.5 tonnes respectively (Kalumiana, 1996).

Source: Kalumiana, 1996 Surveys conducted in the Province also indicated that due to prohibitive electricity tariffs, electric power has not been widely used by many inhabitants. Consequently, most rural and peri-urban populations depend on woodfuel energy (PFAP, 1997). With a population growth rate of 2.2% (1990 census), consumption levels of woodfuel have been increasing over the years and some parts of the Province are now depleted of exploitable wood resources. Places such as islands on lake Bangweulu, swamps and parts of the Luapula valley are the most affected. In Kawambwa District, total timber volume in 1996 was estimated at 42,300m3, of which firewood and charcoal production were 350,000 and 98,000 tonnes/annum respectively. Mansa with a total wood stock volume of 22,095m3 had firewood and charcoal production levels amounting to 107,000 and 18,750 tonnes/annum respectively (PFAP, 1997). Annual deforestation in the entire Province was thus estimated to be around 17,959ha out of which charcoal production accounted for 10,000 ha, representing about 58% of total deforestation. Highest deforestation figures were recorded in Mansa and Nchelenge probably due to increasing population and demand for firewood energy used in fish drying, domestic and agricultural purposes.
Firewood consumed in institutions was not included in calculating the total consumption because data was only collected in Mansa District.

Central Province The total land area for Central Province is 94,494 km2, with total population estimated at 725,611 (1990). The proximity of the Province to Lusaka and the Copperbelt Province, which are the most populated areas in Zambia, has put great pressure and demand for forest products in the Province. Lusaka consumes about 126,625 tonnes of charcoal every year of which 74,075 tonnes come from Central Province. This represents 58.5% of the total woodfuel demand for Lusaka. As a result of this and the charcoal exports to the Copperbelt Province, indigenous forests in Central Province are seriously being cleared for charcoal and firewood production (PFAP, 1997).

About 90% of households in the Province continue to depend on forest products for domestic purposes. For instance, out of a total of 119,464 households interviewed in a recent survey (Kalumiana, 1996), 68.4 % depended on firewood as their main source of cooking energy. The second most common source of energy was charcoal which accounted for 19.3% of total household consumption of cooking energy (Kalumiana, 1996).

Source: PFAP, 1997 The total population between the ages of 12 - 75 years old was estimated at 456,197 in 1996, out of which 182,898 were in one form of employment or another, representing 25.38% of the total population. The total woodfuel consumption in the Province in 1996 was estimated at 52,845.4 tonnes of charcoal and 735,918.4 tonnes of firewood (Kalumiana, 1996). The main reasons given for the ever-increasing woodfuel production and consumption rates were: -Insufficient cheap alternative energy sources; -Low income of inhabitants due to limited income sources and unemployment; -Proximity to the densely populated Provinces of Lusaka and the Copperbelt; -unsustainable management and harvesting methods; -Poor law enforcement by the Forestry Department. Charcoal, firewood, kerosene and electricity are the four major household fuels in Central Province. Urban households consume about 86.2% of total charcoal and 2.4% of firewood consumed in the Province. Rural household consumption figures are about 13.8% and 97.6% for charcoal and firewood respectively (Kalumiana, 1996). Charcoal is the dominant energy source for urban households in low cost residential areas. The survey by Kalumiana (1996) found that the main end-uses for charcoal were cooking, water heating, space heating/warming and ironing. For electrified households, cooking and water heating were found to be the main end uses. It was also found that urban household electrification reduces charcoal consumption to between 1.5 and 3 times. 29 Woodfuel Review and Assessment in Zambia - 1999.
Most charcoal production is done in areas under preparation for agriculture. Areas cleared for agricultural production, therefore, increase with increasing market demand for charcoal. The same survey by Kalumiana (1996) reported that only in Kabwe Rural District was uncontrolled charcoal production found in Forest Reserves. In Serenje and Mumbwa Districts, Forestry Officers allocate coupes to Charcoal producers. In Serenje charcoal producers were reported to be paying for the wood (through licences) and in Mumbwa the practice was that producers paid in kind by providing labour (Kalumiana, 1996). Kalumiana (1996) also reports that there are four charcoal transportation modes used in the Province i.e. bicycles, ox-carts, single and round truck trips. Kerosene use was restricted to lighting and had no effect on woodfuel consumption. Use of electricity was however found to reduce woodfuel consumption because of competition for the same end uses.

Source: Kalumiana, 1996 Energy Consumption Patterns For Central Province, discussions on consumption patterns will focus on Kabwe Urban and Rural Districts based on studies conducted by Kalumiana in 1996. Kabwe Urban District Among the 338 households enumerated (comprising 124, 105 and 109 households in the low, medium and high cost residential areas respectively), it was found that proportions of households using the four main urban fuels were as follows: charcoal, 76.9%; firewood, 18.6%; kerosene, 45.3%; and electricity, 62.4%. Kerosene was used mainly for lighting, with only 4.6% of its consumers using it for cooking (Kalumiana, 1996). Major uses of electricity (in the medium and high cost residential areas) in order of decreasing importance were found to be lighting (100%), cooking (98.6%), water heating (83.6%), ironing (76.3%) and space heating (68.1%).

Source: Kalumiana, 1996 Charcoal consumption is at least three times more in households without electricity than those with it. Out of the 260 charcoal consumer households assessed, 97.3% used it for cooking, 71.9%, 65.8% and 51.9% used it for water heating, space heating and ironing respectively. A small proportion (4.17% in the medium cost households) used charcoal during preparation of floor polish (Kalumiana, 1996).

Only 63 out of the 338 enumerated households were found using firewood. Per capita annual consumption was estimated at 243.99 kg (Table 3.10 above). Total urban household firewood consumption for 1996 was estimated to be 14,051.4 tonnes. Assuming the same consumption rate (Kalumiana, 1996) estimated firewood consumption for the year 2000 to be about 15,571.7 tonnes. The majority (87.3%) of households used firewood for water heating, while about 50% used it for cooking.

Consumption.
Source: Kalumiana, 1996 Hawker Traders (house to house traders) were found to be the most popular source of charcoal to consumers, providing about 55% of all supplies, while about 30% of all consumers got charcoal from Municipal markets. Other sources were at road sides and homestead selling points. Less than 1% of all consumers collected/produced their own charcoal. Of all the firewood consumed by Kabwe urban households, 59% was collected, while 41.3% was purchased (Kalumiana, 1996). Kabwe Urban District was estimated to consume 65.8% and 1.9% of total charcoal and firewood consumption respectively in the Province in 1996 (Kalumiana, 1996). Kabwe Rural District Urban Households: In Kabwe Rural District, urban households were only enumerated in Kapiri Mposhi, which in 1990 had about 66% of all urban residents in the District. Out of a total of 65 households enumerated, 25 were in the low cost and 40 in the medium cost areas respectively. Calculations for total woodfuel consumption assumed that households in the low cost areas constituted 75% and those in the medium cost areas 25% of the total urban households (Kalumiana, 1996).
32 Woodfuel Review and Assessment in Zambia - 1999.
It was found that 67.7%, 4.6%, 33.8% and 61.5% were using charcoal, firewood, kerosene and electricity respectively. Of the total 65 households enumerated, 44 were found to be using charcoal. Annual per capita consumption was estimated to be 179.9 kg/person (Kalumiana, 1996). Table 3.12 : Mean Annual Consumption, kg/person, in 44 Urban Households using Charcoal.

Source: Kalumiana, 1996 Rural Households: Rural households were found dependent on firewood. Charcoal was only used to a very small extent. Out of the 55 households enumerated, it was estimated that per capita firewood consumption was 1,070.69 kg/person/year. Five percent of households were assumed to use charcoal. For 21 enumerated user households, per capita consumption was estimated to be 72.76 kg/person/year (Kalumiana, 1996). By the end of 1996, it was estimated that total woodfuel consumption would be 2,743.5 and 269,146.8 tonnes of charcoal and firewood respectively (Kalumiana, 1996).

Copperbelt Province In 1996, the Copperbelt Province consumed 1,138,111.1 tonnes of wood out of which charcoal accounted for 76% of total consumption. The bulk of this fuel was consumed by households (Kalumiana, 1996). 33 Woodfuel Review and Assessment in Zambia - 1999.
In addition to local consumption, an equivalent of about 79,140 tonnes of wood was exported, in form of charcoal, to Lusaka Urban. Electrified households showed reduced charcoal consumption levels. Household electrification, therefore, had no impact on charcoal consumption, but rather the impact depended on the income levels of consumers. This was shown by some consumers preferring to use electricity only for lighting which was cheaper (Kalumiana, 1996). The woodfuel supply and demand balance showed a deficit of 442,261.0 tonnes in 1996 and 503,115.9 tonnes were expected to be the deficit in the year 2000. This according to Kalumiana (1996) means that about 3,538,080 by 25-kg charcoal bags were produced over and above the supply limit for the Province. In the year 2000, this figure is expected to rise to 4,024,930 by 25 kg bags (Kalumiana, 1996). Even without the portion of charcoal that is exported to Lusaka, the Province's woodfuel balance still shows a negative picture. Hawker traders are an important source of charcoal for households. Energy Consumption Patterns For the Copperbelt Province, energy consumption patterns would be reviewed based on Kalumiana's surveys conducted in Kitwe and Ndola Rural Districts in 1996. Kitwe has been chosen because of its centrality to other towns in the Province, which is also representative of the population distribution, economic activity, effects of unemployment and woodfuel consumption patterns in households and industry in the Province. Ndola Rural on the other hand has been chosen because of its vastness in terms of area, forest resources (both product and service functions) and charcoal production for both local consumption and for export to other Districts within the Province and to Lusaka. Kitwe is, therefore, representative of most urban households, while Ndola Rural is representative of rural households. Kitwe District The population of Kitwe was 199,798, 320,320 and 347,769 in 1969, 1980 and 1990 respectively (Kalumiana, 1996). It grew by 4.4% and 0.8% per annum between the 1969 and 1980 and 1980 and 1990 intercensal periods respectively. The District had the highest density, which in 1969, 1980 and 1990 was 257.1, 412.2 and 447.6 persons/km2 respectively (Kalumiana, 1996).
34 Woodfuel Review and Assessment in Zambia - 1999.
Source: Kalumiana, 1996 A total of 424 urban households were enumerated in Kitwe in a survey conducted by Kalumiana in 1996. Among these households, 72.4% were found to be using charcoal, while 15.6% depended on firewood. With regard to kerosene and electricity, proportions were 56.8% and 74.8% respectively. These figures do not reflect the electrification proportion in the Province, but concerns only those households covered (Kalumiana, 1996). Among the 424 urban households enumerated, 307 were using charcoal. Charcoal consumption in non-mine townships was found to be at least 50% more than in mine townships for medium cost households. For low cost households, non-electrified ones consumed about 50% more than electrified ones. In 1996, it was estimated that urban households in Kitwe consumed 48,617.1 tonnes of charcoal. Assuming the same consumption rates, Kalumiana (1996) estimated that total household charcoal consumption would be about 49,413.0 tonnes in the year 2000. The survey also revealed that 97.1% of the 307 charcoal using households were using charcoal for cooking, 58.0% for water heating, 34.5% for space heating and 37.5% for ironing (Kalumiana, 1996). Only 66 households out of the 424 enumerated were using firewood. Out of these, low cost households accounted for 65%; medium and high cost accounted for 18% and 17% respectively. The main use for firewood was found to be water heating, which accounted for 86.4%. For cooking, space heating, brewing and baking, the proportions were 50.1%, 12.1%, 27.3% and 12.1% of the 66 households respectively. Per capita annual consumption was estimated to be 132.64 kg. Total urban household firewood consumption was estimated at 8,303.4 tonnes in 1996. Using the same consumption rate, firewood consumption for the year 2000 was estimated to be 8,499.6 tonnes (Kalumiana, 1996).

Source: Kalumiana, 1996 Assessment of fuel end-use for kerosene and electricity showed that the majority (93.0%) of those using kerosene used it for fire ignition, while 65.6% used it for lighting. Only 5.4% were using kerosene for cooking. With regard to electricity, major end-uses were lighting (100%), cooking (94.9%), water heating (88.3%), ironing (88.0%) and space heating (79.8%) (Kalumiana, 1996). Ndola Rural District The population of Ndola Rural District increased by 128.5% between 1969 and 1990. It grew by 3.2% and 4.9% per annum between 1969 and 1980 and 1980 and 1990 intercensal periods, respectively (Kalumiana, 1996). Despite this population increase, the District has the lowest density because of its vastness. The population density was 3.1, 4.3 and 7.0 persons/km2 in 1969, 1980 and 1990 respectively (Kalumiana, 1996).

No urban households were enumerated in Ndola Rural District. From experiences obtained in Central and Luapula Provinces, however, it was found that smaller towns had higher per capita charcoal consumption. For this reason, the per capita consumption of low cost households in Kalulushi District of 179.76 kg/person/year, was assumed to apply to urban households in Ndola Rural. The overall firewood per capita consumption for Kalulushi of 113.98 kg/person/year was also assumed to apply in Ndola Rural. It was further assumed that all households used charcoal and firewood (Kalumiana, 1996). With all these consumption levels and patterns, it was estimated that urban household charcoal consumption was 2,396.0 tonnes in 1996 and would reach 2,400.7 tonnes in the year 2000. With regard to firewood, the consumption figures were 1,519.2 tonnes in 1996 and would be 1,522.2 tonnes in the year 2000 (Kalumiana, 1996). Rural Households A total of 60 rural households were enumerated in Chief Nkana's area of Ndola Rural District. Annual per capita charcoal and firewood consumption was estimated to be 90.50 kg and 1027.50 kg/person/year. While all households used firewood, only 15% were assumed to use charcoal.

Charcoal consumption at Nkana Division of ZCCM in 1996 amounted to 376 tonnes. The charcoal was used as a source of carbon to remove oxygen from molten copper by forming CO2. The end product is anode copper. The Division was buying charcoal at ZK70,000/tonne (Kalumiana, 1996). ZAFFICO Ltd. supplied 4,040 m3 of poles to the Division. In addition, 36,000 skimming blocks (wood pieces), equivalent to 1,185 m3 were purchased from individuals. Total wood consumption in 1996 for Nkana Division of ZCCM amounted to 5,225 m3 or 1,010 tonnes (Kalumiana, 1996). The wood was also found to be used in removing oxygen from copper. Luanshya District Companies studied included ZAMEFA and the Match Corporation of Zambia Ltd. These two companies considered together consumed huge quantities of charcoal. In 1996, ZAMEFA consumed 225 tonnes and Match Corporation 600 tonnes of charcoal respectively (Kalumiana, 1996). Although Match Corporation requires 1,000 tonnes for capacity production, charcoal supply is unreliable. It, therefore, also uses coal from Zimbabwe. Studies conducted by Kalumiana (1996) indicated that the Corporation was buying charcoal at ZK80/kg and coal at ZK82/kg.

3.1.4. Lusaka Province Studies done by Kalumiana in 1996 concentrated on Lusaka urban and this paper will therefore present a review of the same. Estimated charcoal consumption by households in Lusaka urban in 1996 amounted to 126,625.1 tonnes, which are equivalent to 3.2 million 90-kg bags of charcoal. Out of this amount, 74,075.7 tonnes (58.5%) came from Central Province, 15,828.1 tonnes (12.5%) from Copperbelt Province, specifically Ndola Rural District. In the year 2000, consumption is projected to be 143,749.3 tonnes. The Lusaka urban market was found to be larger than individual markets in Central and Copperbelt Provinces (Kalumiana, 1997). In December 1996, charcoal prices were on average 30% higher in Lusaka than the highest price on the Copperbelt. This explains the motivation for the export of charcoal to Lusaka (Kalumiana, 1997). Following conventional markets, Kalumiana (1997) reports that homestead traders are second important sources of charcoal for households. In contrast, hawker traders are second important charcoal sources for the Copperbelt and Central Provinces. Kalumiana (1997) attributed this to the fact that most production centres in Lusaka were far off from the reach of hawkers. This also suggested that most of the charcoal used in the Capital City was imported from other Districts and/or Provinces. Firewood consumption by households was estimated at 14,576.8 tonnes in 1996 and projected to be 16,548.2 tonnes in the year 2000. The bulk of this firewood, unlike charcoal, comes from Lusaka Province. Firewood consumption was, therefore, found not to have any effect on the woodfuel demand and supply balance for other Provinces (Kalumiana, 1997).

Residential categories enumerated were as follows: 185, 174 and 130 households in the low, medium and high cost areas respectively. Proportion uses of fuels were found to be charcoal, 72.2%; firewood, 10.4%; kerosene, 43.6%; and electricity, 77.5% (Kalumiana, 1997).

Assessment of fuel end-use showed that 99.4% of those using charcoal used it for cooking. Other uses were heating water (54.1% - mainly for bathing), space heating (43.6%) and ironing (38.5%). The main use of firewood was water heating, with 88.2 % of the 51 user households using it for this purpose. Kerosene was used mainly for ignition (81.0%), illumination (46.5%) and cooking (14.1%) (Kalumiana, 1997). For electricity, the major uses in the medium and high cost residential areas, in order of decreasing importance were lighting (100%), cooking (86.3%), water heating (72.8%), ironing (84.4%) and space heating (67.0%) (Kalumiana, 1997). Of the 489 households enumerated, 353 were using charcoal as shown in Table 3.20 below: Table 3.20: Mean Annual Urban Consumption, kg/person, in 353 Lusaka Urban Households using Charcoal in December, 1996.

Average annual consumption in the low cost households was 186.3 kg per person. With an estimated population of 1,086,527 in 1996, total charcoal consumption was about 114,895.3 tonnes. Annual per capita consumption in electrified households was estimated to be 146.95 kg and 230.59 kg for non-electrified households. In the medium cost residential areas, average annual consumption was 55.6 kg per person. Total charcoal consumption was about 8,191.7 tonnes in 1996. In high cost residential areas, average annual consumption was 39.8 kg per person. Total charcoal consumption was about 3,538.8 tonnes in 1996 (Kalumiana, 1997). Only 51 (10.4%) out of the 489 enumerated households were found to use firewood. In low, medium and high cost areas, 21.6%, 4.6% and 2.0% respectively were using firewood. Mean annual per capita consumption was 129 kg. In addition to other major end uses, 11.8% were using firewood for baking scones, while 9.8% used it for brewing (Kalumiana, 1997). Total firewood consumption for 1996 was estimated at 14,576.8 tonnes, while in the year 2000, projections indicate figures of about 16,548.2 tonnes (Kalumiana, 1997).

During December 1996, the average charcoal price in Lusaka was ZK139.92/kg or ZK 5,596.80 per 40-kg bag. This price was 28%, 29% and 33% higher than the prevailing prices in Kitwe, Ndola Urban and Chingola respectively. These three towns had the highest charcoal prices in 1996 (Kalumiana, 1997). The bulk of the charcoal (59.8%) in Lusaka Urban was sold at Municipal markets. Next in importance were homestead markets which accounted for 30% of charcoal sales. Municipal and homestead markets were found to be important for consumers in the low and medium cost residential areas. Other sources were found to be insignificant. In contrast, consumers in the high cost areas depended solely on Municipal markets for their charcoal supplies. Also about 11% of all their charcoal supplies were purchased from roadside selling points (Kalumiana, 1997).

TRADE IN WOODFUEL.
Trade in woodfuel is only done with a licence that authorises the holder to manufacture and transport woodfuel to any marketing point. Charcoal is the main commercial woodfuel in Zambia because unlike firewood, which can easily be collected within certain vicinities, it fetches good market prices. Charcoal is also preferred with regard to the easiness with which it can be handled and the cleaner combustion experienced when burning the fuel. The major problem with charcoal, however, is in the way it is produced and the kind of losses incurred in its production. The earth kilns used are mostly 10% efficient which implies that in the process of producing charcoal from wood, 90% by weight is lost. From 100 tonnes of wood, therefore, one expects to get only about 10 tonnes of charcoal (Kapiyo, 1996). However, there are localised sales of firewood in peri-urban and highly populated areas. In Lusaka, firewood is on high demand especially for illicit beer brewing and energy for water and cooking. This is because some people in the area can now no longer afford the high prices of charcoal, which is resulting from reduced supplies. Most people would therefore rather reserve charcoal for use only on pertinent and essential activities such as cooking and space heating during cold nights. Collection for firewood is thus putting pressure even on smaller dimension trees and this is beginning to have a negative effect on both the pricing and regeneration of surrounding forests. 43 Woodfuel Review and Assessment in Zambia - 1999.
Funerals in urban centres also consume a bigger tonnage of total firewood supply. The firewood is used in lighting and space warming for mourners and over the years, this has become a tradition that is widespread across the country. With the death rate ever on the upswing, we expect increased trade in firewood that would in most cases be imported from rural areas. With diminishing supplies within reach and increasing distances and transportation costs, prices and trade in firewood and charcoal will continue to increase. However, these two commodities will continue to be cheaper alternative energy sources because the devices used for their conversion to heat energy are still cheaper than the costs for installation and purchase of appliances for facilities such as electricity and biogas production for example. These analyses are based on empirical observations. Other empirical observations done in Kasama by the Forestry Department (1999), have revealed that the brick making industry consumes large quantities of firewood which is either harvested illegally from Forest Reserves or by paying for licence fees at the Forestry Department offices. The firewood is mostly collected by individuals who are not involved in the brick making business - these then sell the firewood to the brick makers. The Forestry Department does not know the actual pricing levels since the people involved do their business illegally. However, a cord (3m3) of firewood under licence issued by the Forestry Department costs ZK5,400. The burnt bricks industry is offering a cheaper alternative construction material to cement blocks, but this is rather creating an imbalance in the consumption of firewood. As a result of this, many areas within the vicinities of the town centre are now devoid of trees. It was also found that small-scale bakeries consume a greater percentage of the charcoal and firewood offered for sale. Households which use both woodfuel and electricity have been found to be more cost effective as they can switch from one energy source to another depending on income levels, type of food cooked, alternating costs of woodfuel and the purpose for which the energy is required (i.e. for lighting, heating, boiling water, etc.). The type of energy used also depends on the availability and cost of devices such as electric stoves, charcoal braziers, electric heaters and electronic devices such as TV and Cassette Recorders, etc. Charcoal unlike firewood, is offered for sale in almost all corners of the country. Surveys conducted in the PFAP Provinces of Central, Copperbelt and Luapula revealed that trade in charcoal is a major livelihood system (Kalumiana, 1996).
Pricing Trends Prices for charcoal and firewood vary from one place to another depending on local demand, availability of wood stocks, income levels of customers, availability of cheaper alternative energy sources and the income levels of the sellers3. In Kitwe, one of the most populated cities in Zambia, a kiln of 12m3 can be sold for ZK200,000. 12m3 when translated into woodfuel cords gives 4 cords which under normal metric conversions are equivalent to between 6 and 12 tonnes depending on the wood species involved. Each cord, under normal kiln production, can produce 10 (25kg) bags of charcoal and the price of one 25kg bag in Kitwe would, therefore, by implication cost ZK5,000. A household of.

six (6) people will thus spend ZK30,000 for 6 (25kg) bags of charcoal consumed by such an average family per month (Nyakabau, 1997). In Kasama, a town in the Northern Province of Zambia, prices for charcoal are in the range of ZK2,500 and ZK3,500 for a 25 kg bag which when extrapolated to monthly figures per household of six (6), gives between ZK15,000 and ZK21,000. This when added to the cost of firewood (at ZK180 per headload4) which amounts to ZK1,800 (for 10 headloads consumed by a family of six per month), gives a total monthly expenditure on woodfuel of between ZK16,800 and ZK22,800. The prices for firewood are based on fees contained in the Forests Act Cap 199 of the Laws of Zambia and may not therefore reflect the true commodity market value as determined by the forces of demand and supply. The figures used in making these calculations are based on woodfuel entirely dependent households. The total monthly expenditure on woodfuel differs from one household to another, depending on family size, fuel mix (use of more than one type of energy source) and monthly income levels of woodfuel dependent households. A charcoal manufacturer producing 24m3 per month will, therefore, make about ZK400,000 and is expected to make a net profit of ZK356,800 after subtracting production costs (ZK43,200) calculated at ZK5,400 per cord. The net balance will further vary with transportation costs, which will also vary with distance between production areas and market outlets. However, traders using bicycles are expected to reap maximum profits because they usually offset transport costs. The mini survey conducted in Kasama also showed that charcoal sales are done on a house to house basis because most of the charcoal offered for sale is obtained illegally and traders can not afford to fall into the drag net of the Forestry Department. The illegal trade is increasing due to the inadequate capacity of the Forestry Department to control exploitation. Other pricing trends in specific areas of the country are as reflected in Kalumiana's papers on woodfuel demand and supply in Central, Copperbelt, Luapula and Lusaka Provinces based on surveys done in 1996. These studies are analysed in the preceding subheads (3.1.1 to 3.1.4).
FORESEEABLE TRENDS IN WOODFUEL.

45 Woodfuel Review and Assessment in Zambia - 1999.
for firewood and conversion into charcoal will continue to rise in almost all Provinces of the country as people struggle to earn a living whilst meeting their daily energy needs. However, in terms of the wood stock resource base, the country is expected to continue losing much of its forest cover and unless measures are taken to reverse current trends, most forest ecosystems will be decimated of the wood resources within the not so distant future. This may sound like a far fetched occurrence, but all factors considered, it would be foolhardy for us to assume that we will continue to enjoy the abundant wood resources the country `presumably' has, without replenishing them. The wood stock balance that has been envisaged to be achieved through interventions suggested by the ZFAP is still mostly on paper, four (4) years after carrying out the surveys that led to such conclusions. It is, therefore, only prudent that the interventions suggested by the ZFAP (1995 - 97) and those by various authors, are given the due and urgent attention and resources required, or else Zambians should starting preparing for calamities that come with deforestation and the eventual desertification. This paper has, therefore strived to highlight a number of pertinent suggestions that should, as a matter of urgency, be attended to if the dream of meeting energy needs through woodfuel is to be realised by many woodfuel dependent Zambians.
Demand and Consumption.
Demand The demand for woodfuel is expected to continue rising as long as cheaper alternative and renewable energy sources are not promoted and made available to the end-users. Current demand levels if unchecked will result in the eventual denudation of most forest areas (especially in urban areas) which, as a matter of consequence will culminate in zero demand for woodfuel because the resource base would be exhausted. Imports of woodfuel from rural to urban areas may fill-up the demand balance in wood deficit areas, but only for a definite period of time. This is so because the forests in rural areas where the woodfuel is coming from are not being managed for regeneration, but are constantly being cut for agricultural expansion, new settlements and charcoal production to supply both rural and urban centres. This will all result in a national `catastrophe' which will plunge the country into a complete malaise. Demand, therefore, will only be satisfied with sustainable and increasing woodfuel supplies, which are a factor of production.
Consumption Consumption like demand is expected to continue rising as populations in most areas continue to increase due to in-migration (from rural to urban), high birth rates and reduced child mortality (assuming that the AIDS scourge will be controlled, together with other fatal diseases which affect the population in the negative). However, current trends have always shown an upward trend in population growth rates irrespective of such adverse factors. Alternative and renewable energy sources available at the moment are 46 Woodfuel Review and Assessment in Zambia - 1999.
too expensive for the majority of Zambians and have not been popularised to the point of adoption. This means that about 90% or even more of the entrant population will continue to add to the already too inflated woodfuel dependent population, as more households continue to fall out of the consumption category for alternative and renewable energy sources due to their increasing procurement prices and prices for electric devices such as stoves and heaters. This can only suggest one thing, that consumption of woodfuel will continue to rise unless Government comes up with a deliberate policy to make available the alternative and renewable energy sources at affordable investment costs to most consumers. This could be achieved by waiving tax on the raw materials, by offering the commodities at subsidised prices, on credit basis and/or by instituting other such measures that may cushion the burden on most income stripped households. The above trends, however, will be followed by periods of low woodfuel consumption due to reduced supply. The demand and hence prices for woodfuel are expected to continue rising bearing a negative effect on the production base. People will either switch to other low-grade alternative fuels such as agricultural residues and animal dung (where available), or, will reduce on the number of domestic chores requiring use of woodfuel. This is expected to impact negatively on the nutritional status of most households, as less food would be prepared each day, well below the nutritional requirements of the individual members forming up the household. Such trends should therefore be counteracted by programmes aimed at promoting cheaper and renewable energy alternatives, improved fuel saving devices and sustainable woodfuel production and/or regeneration.
Supply Supply being a factor of production and demand is expected to exhibit two scenarios: the first being that of initial increase in supply resulting from increased demand, and the second will entail diminishing supply responding to reduced production which is in itself a factor of regeneration. Locally diminished supplies will lead to importation of woodfuel from other areas, but eventually, even such areas will lose their wood stocks and supply on the national scale will thus diminish. Supply will only be increased, or at least maintained at average levels, if we can as a country promote natural regeneration, enrichment planting and plantation forestry in order to supplement the hard pressed and slow growing indigenous forests in denuded areas and homesteads. This could be achieved through agroforestry, which can also expand the household income base and food security. "It should always be remembered that the woodfuel crisis should not be seen as an isolated problem, but as one among many others which affect the socio-economic status of most poor households". Woodfuel shortages should be seen as an indicator of a more general breakdown in the production of biomass. This is so because local people often see urgent needs such as food, shelter and water as more important than woodfuel. The remedies suggested for the woodfuel 47 Woodfuel Review and Assessment in Zambia - 1999.
crisis i.e. planting more trees specifically for woodfuel, and conserving wood by cooking on improved stoves, do not achieve much because they focus only on one component of the overall development problem. Most biomass projects have thus proved to be both economically and socially disruptive. Energy production should, therefore, be seen as just one of the products of an integrated biomass system, which also provides food, building materials, fencing, animal feed, medicines, fertilisers and a range of other natural products. To resolve the energy problem, therefore, development efforts will require to find solutions for the range of problems caused by the shortfall in biomass production, as experienced at the local level. There will be need to use the gap theory which attempts to determine the supply of woodfuel and then matching it with consumption rates for the country or region. Many studies conducted have revealed that demand is out-stripping supply and that there is a gap between consumption and production of woodfuel. Projections using this data (incorporating increasing demand resulting from rising populations), will often predict that the country would be denuded of trees in the not too distant future. Most predictions have however fallen short of their estimations because in most cases, trees are found existing even at the predicted time of denudation. It should therefore be recognised that it is not possible to extrapolate use of woodfuel in a linear fashion and assume woodfuel shortages in this way. People will use less wood by changing their cooking and eating habits and by attempting to switch to other cheaper fuels. Data on consumption and demand are often based on wood stocks that are most suitable for timber and charcoal production ignoring the aspect of firewood. This data is, therefore, highly unreliable. Figures found in most literature for wood stocks often underestimate actual amounts of wood available. Much of the available data on supply of woodfuel comes from forestry data, which is more concerned with volumetric measurements of timber stocks than fuelwood availability. Such data ignores the fact that much fuelwood does not come from managed forests, but from dead branches and twigs, things obtained from trees growing on farmlands, along river banks and roads, or from communal or privately owned land. Woodfuel supplied or available from these so-called "trees outside the forest" is difficult to quantify because they are scattered and variable. Data concerning these trees is often a guess, at worst not available at all. Planners, therefore, require good quality data that reports the production of biomass and accounts for its various forms. It will be important, therefore, for us to collect accurate time series data so that flow charts of the production and use of biomass can be constructed. Collection of data on availability of biomass and the uses to which it is put should be on going.
Trade Trade in woodfuel will continue to increase as long as current unemployment levels continue to rise and sources of income continue to dwindle. The issue of forests being 48 Woodfuel Review and Assessment in Zambia - 1999.
considered common property resources and/or `gifts' from God, makes them more vulnerable for exploitation as a `cheaper' raw material base. People do this precluding the importance of forests as a sure foundation for national development. Since people have no capital to venture into other businesses, trade in woodfuel offers a business opportunity with almost zero capital investment. Unless people are educated on the true value of forests and other income generating ventures promoted, such trends coupled with serious inadequacies in supervision and control of exploitation by the Forestry Department, will mean increased trade in woodfuel which will rank among the top income generating activities. This trade, however, will not be sustainable in the long run as wood stocks diminish and as more people join into the trade. To reduce on trade in woodfuel, there will be need for a strong policy that will promote other income generating ventures within the forest ecosystem and also invigorate agricultural productivity. Promotion of NWFP is, therefore, key in this regard because of the absolute potential of NWFP to expand the income base to levels where households can even afford to invest in other energy sources. Trees in an Agroforestry system will also offer another revenue source, whilst improving the threshold and/or nutrient base of the land for increased agricultural productivity.
RECOMMENDATIONS FOR SUSTAINABLE PRODUCTION AND UTILISATION OF WOODFUEL.
Sustainable Regeneration.
REGENERATION/.
Forest management for sustainable regeneration must consider the type of product and/or service that is envisaged from a forest. Chidumayo (1997), has categorised products and services as follows: Wood Products timber firewood charcoal poles Non-wood Products/Services food grazing medicines ecological services spiritual services.
In his study on Miombo woodlands, Chidumayo (1997), has further suggested the following measures for sustainable regeneration: **The time of cutting/harvesting should be during the months of May to August if maximum production during the first growing season after leaf flush is to be achieved. **In old growth miombo, clear-cutting close to the ground should be encouraged in order to improve pole and timber value of regrowth stands. 49 Woodfuel Review and Assessment in Zambia - 1999.
**To minimise negative environmental impacts, clear-cutting in miombo should be done in strips or coupes with shelterbelts. After the coupes have regrown, the shelterbelts can then be cleared. **In selectively cut areas, trees should either be clear-cut thereafter, or, trees around the cut stumps should be cleared to create larger canopy gaps to improve regeneration. **In order to reduce the damaging effects of fire and to promote forest production, the following measures are suggested:.
In cut over areas, discarded wood debris, if not used for other purposes should be piled away from stumps and patches of dense saplings and then burnt.
In coppiced areas, early burning should be carried out for 10 - 15 years (period required for leaf area recovery) to prevent late dry season fires.
Old growth and other regrowth woodlands should be burnt almost annually before leaf flush (September), to minimise damage to new.
Foliage and to reduce the build up of fuel biomass which occurs in unburned forests. For plantation regeneration, species selection should be the first step and this will depend on goods to be produced by plantation trees e.g. timber, woodfuel, fruits, etc. Suitability of species for plantation will depend on:.
Seed availability.
Seed viability.
Seed germination rate and.
Seedling survival rates. For seed collection and storage, the following should be ensured:     Collection of ripe seeds from ripe fruits/pods. In a Miombo woodland, fruits of the majority of trees ripen during the period of August - December. Mother trees should have desired characteristics. Seeds should be collected during mast years when many trees fruit to ensure adequate genetic variation. Extract seeds from fruits/pods by drying and threshing. Sometimes roasting of spiky pods, or softening pods by soaking in hot water may be desirable before opening the pods. Soaking in water for a day or two to remove pulp can clean pulpy fruits. 50 Woodfuel Review and Assessment in Zambia - 1999.
After extraction, seeds should be sorted to remove dirt, chaff and damaged seeds, by sieving, or hand picking or floatation in water. Non viable seeds float in water and can easily be discarded. If seeds are not immediately required for sowing, they should be stored in tightly sealed and labelled containers. The label should show the species, provenance and date of collection of the seed. For long term storage, seeds should be kept in a cool place (0 - 200C) and stored in plastic containers to avoid water vapour uptake. Nursery techniques should follow laid down procedures for raising miombo trees. Enrichment planting should be encouraged in charcoal production coupes. Recommendations based on Chidumayo (1997).
Sustainable Utilisation.
To sustain woodfuel utilisation, the following would have to be implemented:  Critical analyses and/or assessments will have to be done on woodfuel utilisation trends for households, institutions such as schools and hospitals, light industries such as tobacco drying, fish smoking, bakeries, bricks production, etc. This will enable us to make calculations on energy consumption in urban and rural areas in order to determine the real ground situation. This kind of assessment will be critical for wood energy planning and sustainable production. Charcoal production should be done in efficient kilns, or better still, wood should be burnt directly without first transforming it into charcoal. An energy policy specifically focussed on biomass production should be developed. Other alternative and renewable energy sources should be encouraged. Alternatives such as solar, hydro-electricity, biogas and petroleum products. Hydro-electricity can be achieved through a Government induced electrification programme. Woodfuel production, supply and consumption should be taken into account in urban planning, architecture and housing. Woodfuel accounting and auditing should be a way of determining actual costs of consumption vis--vis production.
51 Woodfuel Review and Assessment in Zambia - 1999.
Devices for the conversion of woodfuel into heat through burning should be improved upon, or where need be, redesigned. The devices should be such that woodfuel is burnt efficiently and heat transferred to perform the intended tasks. Woodfuel technologies and those for alternative renewable sources should be developed within the framework of the local situation. Government policy should formulate and support macro policies that promote smallscale, more sustainable local technologies. Such technologies should bear in mind that local people have knowledge that can lead to solutions of the problems they are facing. This knowledge should be evaluated by community members themselves in the light of their own development objectives and then decisions taken whether or not to upgrade existing technologies or to introduce new ones.
Development agents should therefor take time to:        Understand the social-cultural and economic structure of a society, which are essential before introduction or development of new technologies. New technologies have to adapt to people's needs as perceived by them, rather than first developed with expectation that people will adapt. Participatory approaches at all levels, but especially at working level, are necessary for the development and dissemination of new technologies. Communities should be able to sustain new technologies. This can be achieved by building on locally available resources. Careful monitoring and evaluation is necessary to avoid negative effects and to guarantee long term benefits. Woodfuel promotion programs should be seen to fall in line with other urgent needs such as food, shelter and water. Woodfuel assessment surveys should be undertaken through a combination of remote sensing and ground truthing techniques.
52 Woodfuel Review and Assessment in Zambia - 1999.
CONCLUSION In Zambia today, there exists an information gap on total woodfuel that are used in their various forms by different consumer groups. Black liquor in specific may not be attainable as a woodfuel in the near future unless Government can come up with a deliberate Policy to promote and support creation of pulp and paper mills which are conspicuously missing in the present industrial set-up. Efforts in promoting usage of woodfuel such as chips, pellets and/or charcoal briquettes, sawdust and wood shavings from carpentry workshops, should be looked at seriously. However, this too may encounter some resistance from woodfuel end-users because of the `seemingly' abundant solid volume of wood stocks that currently exist on the ground. Even in highly populated and thus high woodfuel consumption areas, residents still see a supply source in adjacent rural areas. Where the solid wood stocks may not exist, switching of and/or mixing of fuels may not be achieved due to the eminent lack of alternative technology and/or adequate income to fill the void created. Current low trends of industrial and technological development entail that industrial consumption of woodfuel and thus woodfuel by-products such as sawdust, liquids like methanol, ethanol and pyrolitic oils and gases can not be achieved in adequate quantities. If efficiency of woodfuel utilisation is to be increased, there will be need to improve on technology of conversion of industrial wood by-products into a form that can retain the heat value and be made available at an affordable price to the various categories of consumers. There will also be need for Government Policy to be steered in this direction so that investors are attracted in the business. Isolated cases of people using wood chips as fuelwood have been observed in specific localities where solid wood stocks are scarce, but these are insignificant when compounded to the national scale. Maybe what should be done is to institute technology that would form briquettes from sawmilling dust, which at the moment is causing serious disposal problems to mill operators across the country. Government should not just sit back and watch as the forest ecosystem is plundered, being valued only as a source of fertile soils and woodfuel energy; there should be a network of solution avenues established, both direct and indirect, which will sustain our forests as a foundation for wood products and services such as habitats for wildlife, catchment for headwaters, nutrient base for agricultural production and as a regulator of the atmospheric gases. Current levels of energy demand can be satisfied and wherever possible enhanced, by ensuring sustainable regeneration of forests and also by providing alternatives to woodfuel such as biogas, solar power, hydro-electricity and petroleum products like kerosene. However, as stated in this paper, these are high capital investment ventures and will need total government commitment in terms of subsidies, tax alleviation, credits and any such measures that may assist both the urban and rural poor to access these alternative energy sources. There will also be need to promote efficient use of woodfuel by improving on conversion technologies and use of wood by-products. Careful analyses 53 Woodfuel Review and Assessment in Zambia - 1999.
and detailed research into alternative energy sources, appropriate conversion technology and use of wood by-products would, therefore, be inevitable if the energy requirements of the country are to be met equitably and sustainably, without incapacitating the forest and other ecosystems (life-supporting systems) in the environment.
