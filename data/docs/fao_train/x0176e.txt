Executive summary
Executive summary
This report provides an analytical summary of both quantitative and qualitative data and information on women in agriculture, supplied by seventeen country coordinators (focal points) in the Near East region. The data clearly demonstrates that rural women play a significant role in agricultural and food production and in household food security, both as paid and unpaid labour. In countries such as Egypt, Morocco, Somalia and Turkey, women constitute over 50% of the total labour engaged in agriculture; while in Pakistan, Cyprus, Sudan, Tunisia, Syria, Lebanon and Iraq, at least one-third of the labour required to sustain agricultural production is provided by women.
Although the majority of rural households in the Near East are headed by men, the number of women-headed households is increasing as a result of, inter alia, male migration, widowhood and divorce. The percentage of female-headed households is highest in Pakistan and Sudan (25% and 23.8% respectively). Data provided on household consumption and expenditure shows that female-headed households are poorer than male-headed ones, as the latter are able to earn higher wages and thus capable of saving and consuming more.
Women in the region spend long hours every day in crop and livestock production. In crop production, they are involved in almost all aspects, with the exception of land preparation and other mechanized and capital-intensive activities. The tasks women perform are often non-mechanized and labour-intensive. Thus, women broadcast seeds and fertilizers by hand, hand weed and harvest, pick fruits and vegetables and carry produce on their back. Women also spend many hours in post-harvest activities such as threshing, cleaning, sorting and grading.
Further analysis of the available information shows that women's role in livestock production is even greater, as they are often responsible for all aspects of animal husbandry, with the exception of herding and marketing. Hence, they feed and water, gather fodder, care for small ruminants, rabbits and poultry, clean stables, collect dung for fertilizers and fuel, care for the sick, pregnant and lactating animals, milk, make butter, cheese and ghee, and breed and select animals.
Compared to their critical roles in crop and livestock production, women's contribution to fisheries and agroforestry is less substantial. This is partly due to the limited role these subsectors play as a source of employment in many countries of the Near East region.
Rural women spend much time every day on agricultural and domestic tasks, with little time for rest or recreation. As paid and/or unpaid labour, women may spend up to 19 hours/day performing essential chores such as sowing, weeding, harvesting, animal husbandry, cleaning, fetching water and firewood, baking, cooking, sewing, child rearing, etc., to ensure the livelihood of the farming household. Nevertheless, data from the country papers indicates that women are not usually remunerated for their work, with clear disparities in wages between men and women in most countries of the region. In many countries women are often paid two-thirds or even half of the wages earned by men for the same task.
In spite of the labour and income contributions of women to the farming household, men appear to have predominant control over decision-making. However, more in-depth studies are needed to determine the precise roles and powers each gender has in household decision-making processes, as some studies have indicated that decisions are often made jointly between men and women. Due to cultural norms, women may wield more indirect power in several important matters such as family and household matters. Women also have a greater say in the aspects of production in which they are heavily engaged, such as poultry, dairy products and handicrafts. Unlike other pursuits in which men are involved, women are generally left alone to make their decisions regarding these enterprises, such as when to sell, how much to sell for, and what to do with the earnings. However, women are rarely consulted on issue such as loan and credit applications and management, or in other financial matters.
Women's access to, and control over, productive resources (especially land, labour, inputs and labour-saving technology) and support services (credit, extension, training and markets) is limited. Very few credit-lending arrangements have been set up especially for women farmers, and only a small number apply for credit. This is mainly attributed to weak institutional structures, traditional beliefs and cultural practices, a high degree of illiteracy, poor education, as well as women's lack of collateral. A number of encouraging initiatives have been taken by some countries to remedy this situation. For example, in Egypt, the recent establishment of a strong Policy and Coordination Unit for Women in Agriculture, in the Ministry of Agriculture, has begun to address some of these constraints.
Although information on land ownership patterns by gender is scarce in the region, what little is available affirms that only a small proportion of arable land is owned by women. Women landowners often prefer to have their land managed by male relatives or transfer land titles to them in return for a portion of the land's remittances or other considerations. Women rarely purchase land and those who own land do so mainly through inheritance.
Extension services especially designed to target women farmers are also limited. In fact, the large majority of extension officers are male, who deal almost exclusively with male farmers since tradition often constrains interaction between women and outsiders. The few existing qualified female extension workers usually provide women with training in traditional home-based activities such as child-care and home management, with little or no training in the more entrepreneurial income-generating activities, such as crop and livestock production, agro-industries, protected agriculture, etc.
Data from the country papers emphatically asserts the need for energy and burden-saving technologies to reduce the heavy workload and time women spend on agricultural and domestic tasks. So far, techniques that have been developed to increase efficiency and productivity have often been taken over by men, leaving women to perform the more difficult and labour-intensive functions, at a time when new technologies are making old practices obsolete.
Female illiteracy in the Near East region, especially in the rural areas, is exceptionally high (reaching in some areas 90%) in spite of major wide-scale campaigns to address this serious issue. Furthermore, although primary school education is compulsory for both boys and girls in most countries, the data indicates that rural girls are at a disadvantage compared to rural boys and to their urban counterparts. In addition to the scarcity of schools at the village level, girls are discouraged to attend because of tradition, and are often pulled out of school to marry early or to contribute to the much-needed labour on the household farm.
Although the number of women seeking higher agricultural education in the region is on the rise, women's enrollment rates are lower than those of men. Women tend to specialize in selected subjects such as nutrition and agricultural economics, while men often specialize in agricultural engineering, and crop and animal science.
Women are also underrepresented in power structures throughout the region. In ministries of agriculture, only a few women hold high-ranking policy-making positions (8.7%, 6%, and 4.8% in the Islamic Republic of Iran, Turkey and Egypt, respectively). A few women are likewise office-bearers, employees or members of agricultural organizations such as cooperatives and rural credit associations.
Most countries have recently established WID units or other machineries to empower women at various levels, including in their ministries of agriculture and related ministries with activities in rural areas. However, the number and scope of these units varies from country to country. With the exception of a few, the majority appear to be poorly funded and supported, often lacking clear-cut objectives and sufficient human and technical resources.
NGO support to rural women is minimal in the region. Most NGOs operating in rural areas are typically welfare-type institutions, with objectives geared to education, health, and family planning. A few have been active in promoting small-scale income-generating activities for women. However, these initiatives tend to benefit only a very small number of women and are limited to traditional activities such as sewing, embroidery, carpet-making and small-scale animal husbandry projects.
Most countries in the region have passed legislation stipulating equal pay for equal work, as well as gender equality in access to education, employment, ownership, social security benefits and legal rights. However, only three countries out of twenty-seven have ratified the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) without reservations. A few have implemented specific legal actions to secure women's rights and facilitate their access to land, livestock, credit, employment and membership in rural organizations. In addition, measures to increase public awareness of women's rights and responsibilities have been limited to one-time affairs, such as national workshops, seminars, publications, and a World Food Day dedicated to rural women.
The majority of the programmes and projects in support of rural women tend to be isolated and dispersed, and target only a small number of women beneficiaries. In general, these endeavours have not been innovative per se, but are rather first-time initiatives in, for example, training women, or in the creation of income-generating activities using mostly traditional female skills, such as sewing, weaving, cheese-making and poultry-rearing. Few projects have aimed at providing women with credit and up-to-date technology (e.g., biogas technology, mechanization, entrepreneurial and managerial skills, etc.) to increase their economic gains and improve the efficiency of their work. Moreover, none of the projects or initiatives appear to aim at 'mainstreaming' gender-sensitive considerations throughout agricultural and rural development approaches. As a result, attempts to improve the conditions of rural women in the Near East often remain small-scale, localized and isolated.
International support to rural women in the region is insufficient. Internationally sponsored projects either target women directly in women's projects or indirectly by including a WID component to the projects which they support. In general, most endeavours have been limited to the elimination of illiteracy, and the improvement of education, health and family planning services, as well as training and funding of traditional small-scale income-generating activities.
An assessment of the future strategic goals and objectives provided by the seventeen participating countries indicates many commonalities in their vision for future action. All expressed the need for a broad-based action-oriented framework, with corresponding financial commitments, and for the empowerment of women in agriculture and the implementation of priority programmes and activities. This approach is expected to enhance regional cooperation and networking to redress gender gaps, and thus increase sustainable agricultural production and balanced human growth.
The thrust of the FAO/RNE WID programme of activities is in response to the above. It is geared to the development of a Regional Plan of Action for Women in Agriculture in the Near East (1996-2000), or RPAWANE 2000, through a participatory people-centred approach. RPAWANE 2000's main elements are based on substantive information collected and analyzed from the seventeen country papers, and as such, conform with the demands, needs and commitments of the Near East countries. These have been grouped in four priority areas of concern: collection, analysis and dissemination of gender-disaggregated statistical data; institutional support and capacity building; women in agriculture and sustainable development (with emphasis on gender, environment and population); and networking and people's participation.
RPAWANE 2000 is presently being prepared in close collaboration with FAO Headquarters (SDWW). It will conform with the overall objectives and structure of the Organization-Wide Plan of Action for Women in Development (1996-2001), and will be adapted to suit the realities of women in the Near East. It is expected to be discussed, enriched and adopted by the countries of the region in a consultation that will be held for this purpose in Ankara, Turkey, from 4 to 6 October 1995, drawing on the same interactive and transparent approach.

Introduction
Introduction
This report presents a synthesis of information on women in agriculture in seventeen countries of the Near East region.^1 The objectives of the synthesis report are to: (a) provide quantitative, qualitative and comparative data on women in agriculture in the Near East region; and (b) furnish a baseline document to assist in developing a Regional Plan of Action for Women in Agriculture in the Near East (1996-2000), or RPAWANE 2000. RPAWANE 2000's overall goal is to ensure an evolving and dynamic understanding, at different levels, of the situation of women in agriculture in order to improve their status and enhance their contribution to sustainable agriculture by defining strategies and instruments with reachable targets. Equally important is promoting the integration of women's concerns in the agendas of Member Nations and United Nations fore.
^1 Cyprus, Egypt, Iran (I.R. of), Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon, Mauritania, Morocco, Oman, Pakistan, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, Tunisia, Turkey, United Arab Emirates (UAE), and Yemen.
RPAWANE 2000 is a sequential and broad-based initiative that started in early 1993 in cooperation with the seventeen countries, FAO Headquarters, other UN Agencies, regional institutions and NGOs RNE/WID has at present an informal network of seventeen country coordinators who in 1994 prepared country papers on women in agriculture, through the use of participatory mechanisms and tools. The papers were based on an outline and innovative guidelines, which were enriched and finalized in an Expert Consultation held for this purpose in December 1993. The outline corresponds to the UN Secretariat's reporting requirements on the advancement of women for the Fourth World Conference on Women, Beijing, China, 4-15 September 1995.
The Synthesis Report is a product of consolidated information as taken from the country papers, and is supplemented by additional data from other sources, as indicated. As the individual country reports reference the data provided in terms of source and year, for the purpose of this report, national source references are not repeated. A complete list of references, including the country papers, can be found in the Bibliography.
Various means were used by the country coordinators to collect the data for the country papers, such as participatory and rapid rural appraisals (PRAS and RRAS), national workshops and consultations, field trips, reviews of national statistical data and surveys and other available documents, etc.
Several methodological problems were encountered in the preparation of the Synthesis Report. Due to the lack of up-to-date gender-disaggregated statistical data in many participating countries, some information was missing or outdated. Country papers also exhibited wide variations in following the outline, and the statistical information provided made comparisons among countries difficult. In some countries, data was provided for the same variable but for different years, making comparisons over time difficult. Thus, caution was taken in interpreting the data presented.
Moreover, it is necessary to be cautious when making generalizations about the situation of rural women at the regional level as it often differs not only among countries but also within a country, depending upon the socio-economic and ethnic groups to which women belong, and to environmental and other factors characteristic of a particular area.
Despite these limitations, the Synthesis Report represents a useful contribution to assimilating information about women in agriculture in the Near East region. It also provides an analytical synopsis of their roles and responsibilities and identifies the major constraints within which they operate.
The first section of the report provides a brief overview of the Near East region, summarizing the agricultural environment and highlighting the general backdrop against which rural women conduct their activities. The second section pulls together data from the country papers to establish the extent of women's participation in agricultural work. An overall description of the division of labour in crop, livestock, fisheries and agroforestry is then provided, as is an examination of the available data on the time women spend in agricultural and domestic tasks, together with gender disparities in wage earning and decision-making. The fourth section examines gender gaps in women's access to productive resources and services and economic structures, such as credit, land, extension, labour-saving technology and higher agricultural education. The fifth section provides an analysis of the level of institutional support for rural women in the Near East, such as policy-making
positions in ministries of agriculture, WID units and NGOs The commitment of countries to internationally recognized women's rights, as well as innovative programmes, projects and international support targeting rural women in the region are then evaluated. The final section consolidates information on future strategic goals and objectives provided by each country, which set the basis for RPAWANE 2000's four priority areas of concern, as requested by the countries of the region.

Overview of the near east region
Agriculture in the near east
While countries in the region exhibit extraordinary variability in their economic, social and political structures, they nevertheless share some common environmental and agricultural features that permit them to be treated as a relatively consistent group vis-a-vis a number of important aspects of agricultural production and food security. The region is predominantly arid or semi-arid, and agriculture is primarily rainfed. Temperatures are often extreme and rainfall is both scarce and variable from one growing season to the next. As a result, agriculture is a risky enterprise, and farmers, especially those with small landholdings, often adopt production strategies, such as crop and livestock diversification, to minimize the risks associated with a variable and difficult climate.
A little over half of the region's population live in rural areas, and agriculture engages about one third to one half of its workforce (fully 1990). Population growth is very rapid, with countries such as Algeria, Egypt, Iraq, Iran and Syria registering some of the highest growth rates in the world. While many countries were either self-sufficient in food production or even food exporters in the early 1960s, today, alarming quantities of foodstuffs are currently being imported into the region (about US$20 billion) to satisfy increasing demands.
A predominant proportion of the work associated with agricultural and food production is conducted by men, women and children within the context of a farming household (Glavanis and Glavanis 1983). Farm size tends to be small, with most farms constituting about 10 hectares (ha) or less, and occupying 25 % of the total arable land. Most farmers are subsistence farmers. However, large farms of 50 ha or more occupy 15 % to 45 % of the total arable land, yet constitute only a small percentage of the total number of farms (Belaid and Morris 1991). The tendency for the majority of farms in the region to be small prevents them from absorbing the available labour in large families, let alone incurring the costs of hiring labour from outside the farm. A high dependency of the farm household on the labour market for outside additional income affects the composition of farm households, with women, children and older men left behind to carry out a large bulk of the agricultural work.
Thus, because of high rural population growth rates, the lack of jobs in rural areas, low wages in agriculture, and the seasonality in the demand for agricultural labour, the region suffers from very high male temporary and permanent urban-to-rural migration as well as immigration from the poorer countries to the Arab Gulf Countries and Western Europe. Although the overwhelming majority of urban and rural households are headed by men in the Near East, women-headed households occupy a considerable percentage of total rural households and their number is increasing as a result of high migration. For example, almost a quarter of all rural households in Pakistan and the Sudan are currently headed by women. Consequently, women farmers have increasingly found themselves becoming major contributors to the agricultural labour force, the majority of whom work for very long hours all year long as unpaid family labour.
The situation of women in the early 1980s
By the early 1980s, women in most countries of the region had already been granted equal rights under their constitutions, especially with regard to education, employment, social security and welfare services, although some countries introduced such provisions later than others. Thus, women were given the right to vote and hold office in Iraq in 1980, and in Yemen in 1983. In Jordan, while women were granted the right to vote and run for parliamentary elections in 1974, their right to vote and run for municipal elections was granted only in 1982.
Although several women organizations did exist in some countries prior to the early 1980s,^2 little attention was given to rural women by policy-makers. National plans and development strategies had not yet fully recognized the contribution of women to food production and the importance of addressing their needs in the production process. However, increased awareness of policy-makers in the early eighties, primarily due to international efforts, led to the establishment of several important governmental offices. In Egypt, in 1977, a WID unit was established at the Ministry of Social Affairs, and a National Commission of Women was set up during the same year. In Jordan, a Women's Department was established at the Ministry of Social Development in 1980, and in Yemen, several WID units were set up in various ministries beginning in 1978 with international assistance. In Tunisia, a women's ministry was set up in 1983, while in Mauritania, several governmental units were already
in place to deal with the increasing recognition of the importance of rural women in agricultural production. In Cyprus, an interministerial committee was appointed to study the position of women in society, and in 1983, two Law Reform Committees were established to revise family law to eliminate discrimination against women and ensure equal rights. In Pakistan, a women's division was established in 1979, which was later upgraded to a Ministry for Women Development.
^2 The General Federation of Iraqi Women (established in 1969); The Feminist Union and the Consultative Council for Women in Mauritania (established in 1962 and 1964, respectively); Tunisia's Women's Union and very progressive Personal Status Code (1956).
In addition to the lack of institutional support for rural women, only a very small number of projects and programmes were designed to target rural women. Furthermore, most organizations and institutions dealing with rural women had no or very few women employed at the policy-making level and very few women professionals existed to promote the cause of rural women. Indicators such as illiteracy, deteriorating health conditions, and the increase of female-headed households, as well as the lack of women's access to economic structures and productive processes (credit, land, education, technology, information, training, etc.), reflect the extent to which rural women in the early eighties were neglected in the development efforts of most countries in the region.

Due to inconsistencies and poor methods in data collection and reporting, and because of narrow definitions of work and employment in national statistics, data often fails to capture the real contributions of women's work in the Near East region. As a result, there has been a widespread erroneous notion that women in the region have a marginal role in all sectors of the economy, including that of agriculture. However, more recent efforts to include disaggregated data by gender at the national level, as well as information gathered in micro-studies and special surveys, have shown that women's contribution to agricultural labour has been severely underestimated, and that in fact, women's participation rates are indeed quite significant, especially when unpaid labour is taken into account.
Table 1 provides data on women's participation in the labour force, and in agriculture in particular. The data indicates wide variations among countries in the region. For example, in Somalia, Cyprus and Turkey, women constituted 39 %, 38 % and 31 %, respectively, of the total number of persons employed in the labour force in the 1990-92 period. In Egypt, Lebanon, Morocco, Tunisia, Mauritania and Pakistan, women constituted between 21 % and 29% of total persons actively employed, whereas in the Gulf Region, the percentages for Oman and the United Arab Emirates were as low as 8% and 6%, respectively, in 1990-92.
A significant proportion of employed women work in the agricultural sector. For example, in Mauritania, Turkey and Sudan, the percentage of employed women working in agriculture in the 1990-92 period was 84%, 83%, and 82% respectively. In Iraq, Syria, Morocco, Tunisia, Cyprus, Iran and Pakistan, the proportion ranged from 24% to 45%.
Additional data from the country papers indicates that women, as paid and unpaid labour, represent an important source of total agricultural labour in the region. In Turkey, Morocco, Egypt, Lebanon, Sudan, Iraq and Mauritania, women were estimated to constitute 55.3%, 53.2%, 50.7%, 40.7%, 34.7%, 30.7% and 28% of total paid and unpaid agricultural workers respectively. In Syria, women constituted 44.4% of wage labourers and 60% of unpaid farm labour, and in Tunisia, 34.7% of the total temporary paid labour were women. In Somalia, 66% of the labour in subsistence farming was provided by women. In Cyprus, women constituted 44% of the total paid labour, while in Pakistan, women comprised 42% of the total family labour.
Data provided on rural unemployment indicates considerable variation among countries in the region, and reflects the seasonality in the demand for labour in agriculture. In cereal growing areas for example, most of the agricultural labour is needed in the fall and early winter months for cereal sowing, and again during harvesting, usually in June. This leaves approximately 5-6 months for farmers to seek employment elsewhere. However, work opportunities outside agriculture in the rural areas are limited in most countries, which contributes to increasing unemployment and underemployment of men and women alike, and to temporary and permanent migration of men to the urban areas. In the Islamic Republic of Iran, the percentage of unemployed rural women increased from 21.1% to 30.9% in the 1980-1993 period. In Iraq and Tunisia, women's unemployment appears to have increased considerably in the past decade. In Tunisia, it is estimated that 40% of women were underemployed in 1989.
In contrast, unemployment for rural women in Egypt relatively declined during the 1980's, and in Morocco, rural women's unemployment was 1.5% compared to 8.4% for men. The unemployment rate for women in Turkey was less than that of men, and decreased by more than half in the 1985-1992 period, from 5.9% to 2.5%. However, caution should be exercised in interpreting the data on rural female unemployment and underemployment in the Near East. More detailed studies should be carried out in order to examine the variables influencing the decrease or increase in rural female unemployment (e.g., migration, lower wages for women, climatic and agronomic factors affecting crop yields, etc.). In addition, differences in the definitions of "employed," "underemployed," and "unemployed" must be clearly understood in cross-national studies.

Female-headed households
In all countries of the region, the overwhelming majority of urban and rural households are headed by men, although women-headed households constitute a considerable percentage of total rural households, and are increasing in some countries as a result of temporary and permanent rural-to-urban male migration as well as immigration abroad. In addition to male migration, widowhood and divorce also contribute to an increase in the number of households headed by women. As shown in Table 2, the percentage of female headed households is highest in Pakistan and Sudan, 25% and 23.8% respectively, followed by Egypt (16%), Morocco (16%), Cyprus (13%), Lebanon (11%), Tunisia (11.3%), Turkey (7.1 %), Syria (6.1 %) and the Islamic Republic of Iran (5.6%).
In general, data from the country papers indicates that while female-headed households are smaller in size than those headed by men, they are also significantly poorer. For example, household expenditures for rural female-headed households in 1991 were 10% more than for male-headed households in Morocco. Female-headed households were the worst to be hit by drought in the Sudan. In Turkey, in 1987, income earned by female headed households was less than male-headed households, and they also saved less. The average monthly income of a male-headed household in Turkey was estimated to be 1.5 times more than that of a female-headed household, consumption was 1.43 times greater, and savings were 2.2 times higher. PRA studies in Iraq showed that female-headed households consumed, produced, saved and invested less, and in Syria, 75.3% of rural women were unable to save any portion of their earnings.

"The percentage of female-headed households varies widely by region within Sudan. Figures for 1983 show that in the west, for example, the average percentage of female-headed households was 35%, while in the south it was approximately 40%.
The status of rural women
In the Near East region, a significantly large proportion of the population is rural (Table 3). In Egypt, Yemen, Mauritania, Morocco, Somalia, Sudan, Oman, Pakistan and Turkey, over 50% or more of the population lives in rural areas. With the exception of a few countries such as Jordan, Lebanon, Tunisia, Oman, Cyprus and Turkey, a quarter or more of the rural population lives below the poverty line (Jazairy et al. 1992). In many countries with a large rural population such as Sudan, Egypt, Morocco and Pakistan, the absolute numbers of rural people living in poverty can be quite significant.

Additional data on poverty provided by the country papers indicates that rural household expenditures on food are quite high. In Mauritania and Morocco, 63% and 55% of total expenditures in rural households are spent on food, while in Syria, 70% of rural household income is spent on food, medicine and health care.
As in the rest of the world, women's life expectancy is slightly higher than men's in the Near East region. However, figures remain considerably lower than those in the developed countries, and there appears to be differences in life expectancy figures between urban and rural women. For example, life expectancy at birth for women in Mauritania, Yemen, Somalia and the Sudan are as low as 47, 48, 48 and 52.4 years respectively. In Tunisia and the UAE, where figures for the same year were available to make urban-rural comparisons, rural women had a life expectancy of 68.5 and 73 years respectively, compared to 72.3 and 73.5 years respectively for their urban counterparts.
Although notable progress has been made in providing modern health care services to rural areas, maternal mortality rates remain quite high, especially in the poor rural areas where maternal health care is severely limited. For example, in 1992, maternal mortality rates per 100,000 live births were 184 and 120 in Egypt and Iraq, respectively. In Mauritania and Yemen, rates as high as 500 and 1000 per 100,000 live births were recorded.
In spite of the differences in the level of maternal-child health care in the region, there remains an urgent need to provide rural women with better access to contraceptives, medication, pre and post-natal care, supervised deliveries, and effective health and hygiene education. In Tunisia, Morocco, the Islamic Republic of Iran and Turkey, 31.2%, 31.6%, 44% and 56% of rural women used some type of contraceptive, while only 13.8% and 37% of births were supervised in rural Morocco and Tunisia. In Mauritania, only 30.8% of women who had given birth received any post-natal follow-up, while in Turkey, in 1993, 27% of rural women received some level of pre-natal supervision and 40% delivered at a health-care centre.
Another indicator of poverty is child malnutrition. Although it is difficult from the available data to make any conclusive statements regarding the extent of rural child malnutrition, the data provided shows that a significant number of children in rural areas are undernourished, and that rural children are more likely to suffer from malnutrition than their urban counterparts. However, there appears to be no clear-cut trends regarding nutritional differences between boys and girls in the rural areas of these countries. A study conducted in Egypt in 1988 showed that 35% of rural children were stunted compared to 26% of urban children. In Jordan, a 1990 Population and Family Health Survey using height-for-age measures indicated that 8.9% of rural children were malnourished, compared to 7.5% living in other areas, and that boys were more likely to be malnourished than girls. A 1987 study in Morocco showed that 36.7% of rural children under five years of age suffered from
malnutrition, compared to 21.4% for urban children. Furthermore, the study shows that compared to girls, boys were more likely to be malnourished (9.6% vs. 8.4%). Data from Tunisia indicates only slight differences in malnutrition between urban and rural children of the same sex. In 1984, the infant mortality rate in rural Tunisia was 72.1 per 1,000 live births for boys, and 59.8 per 1,000 live births for girls, whereas in urban areas infant mortality rates were considerably lower (44.6/1,000 for boys and 36.9/1,000 for girls). In the Islamic Republic of Iran, rural children were more likely to suffer from malnutrition than urban children, and girls were more likely to be malnourished than boys. Thus, the extent of malnutrition for boys in urban and rural areas in the Islamic Republic of Iran was 10% and 15% respectively, while for girls in these categories it was 15% and 23% respectively.
The number of illiterate women in the region is very high (Table 4). An analysis of the data indicates that female illiteracy is significantly higher than that of males. More women are illiterate in rural areas compared to urban areas, and a larger number of older women are illiterate compared to younger women. The majority of countries in the region are committed to combatting female illiteracy, and many regularly conduct wide-scale campaigns and other concerted efforts to address this serious problem. Many of these initiatives have been successful in reducing rural female illiteracy in the past two decades.

Primary school education for both boys and girls is compulsory by law in many countries of the region. Education provided by governmental primary and secondary schools is often free of charge. As a result, there has been a significant increase in the enrollment of girls in primary and secondary school, and in some countries, there are more girls than boys enrolled at both levels. However, data from most countries indicates that tradition still dictates that girls do not go to school, but rather, remain at home to marry early and undertake household and agricultural tasks. Thus, girls are less likely to enroll in schools than boys, and the drop-out rate for girls is visibly higher, especially at the primary level.
In the rural areas, the gap between boys and girls in primary and secondary school enrollment is larger than in urban regions (Table 5). This is mainly attributed to economic necessity and stronger conservative traditions, as well as the limited number of schools at the village level, which strengthens the reluctance of parents to send their girls to distant educational facilities.

The role of women in crop, livestock, fisheries and agroforestry
An analysis of the data provided by the country papers clearly demonstrates that women spend long hours daily performing numerous time-consuming and labour-intensive work in all aspects of agricultural production. This is in addition to their regular responsibilities within the household dwelling itself, such as child bearing and rearing, housekeeping, cleaning, cooking, baking and fetching water and fuel for domestic use. Indeed, available time-use data indicates that women in Cyprus, Jordan, Morocco, Lebanon and Yemen, for example, may work anywhere from 11-16 hours every day on agricultural and household tasks. These heavy workloads leave very little time for rest, leisure, or the pursuit of activities other than work.
The extent to which rural women are involved in agricultural production is a function of numerous interlinked factors. These include the type of farming system, the degree of mechanization used on the farm, farm size, available male labour, and a woman's social and economic status within the household as well as within society.
It has been observed that women are less likely to be involved in more mechanized and capital-intensive farms geared to market-oriented production. Also, women from landless families and/or small landholdings perform more tasks and work for longer hours than those from large landholdings and rich rural households. Poor women are more likely to seek off farm employment or employment on other farms, as hired temporary or permanent labour. Moreover, they are more liable to work in agriculture in regions and countries where there is heavy male-outmigration to urban areas and abroad. Thus, in countries like Egypt, Yemen, Turkey and Syria, where large numbers of men seek off-farm employment, women and children are left behind to do the bulk of the agricultural work. In addition, at what stage a woman is in her life cycle determines her status in the household and consequently her contribution to family or hired agricultural work. In general, it is the young, unmarried women who do
the bulk of female work in the Near East region.
Women in crop production
As paid or unpaid labour, women are heavily involved in subsistence crop production, and a few activities related to cash crop production. Although there are no clear-cut "women's" crops as might exist in some countries of the world, a gender division of labour is observed in the farming systems of the region based on the nature of the agricultural enterprise itself, and on the operations used in the production process. Consequently, men are involved in capital-intensive mechanized crops and operations (mechanical land preparation, irrigation, spraying, mechanical harvesting, tractor-driving, etc.), while women are responsible for the more labor-intensive work that requires painstaking physical effort, patience and perseverance. Thus, women use their hands or simple tools to broadcast seeds and fertilizers, hand weed and harvest, pick fruits and vegetables manually, and carry produce on their backs. They likewise spend many long hours in post-harvest activities such as
threshing, winnowing, cleaning, sorting, grading and bagging. With some exceptions notwithstanding, women in the region participate very little in land preparation, transportation and marketing of agricultural produce.
Despite the above gender division of labour, it is also common for women and men to work side-by-side together in the field, and assist one another in various crop, livestock and other tasks when the need arises, especially during peak season. Annex I provides more detailed information on women's roles in crop production in selected countries of the region.
Women in livestock production
Livestock production is an important and integral component of farming systems in the Near East region. In nomadic and semi-nomadic societies, livestock rearing is the main production activity and the source of most, if not all, economic output. Livestock also contributes a large proportion of the income of farmers with small-landholdings, which are by far the most common type of farms in the region.^3
^3 Farms constituting 10 hectares or less occupy 25% of total arable land in West Asia and North Africa. Conversely, large farms of 50 hectares or more occupy 15 to 45% of the total arable land, but constitute only a small percentage of the total number of farms (Belaid and Morris, 1991).
Women's work in animal husbandry is significant. In general, women are more involved in livestock production - especially small ruminants - than in crop production. According to the data provided in the country papers and other studies, women are heavily involved in almost all aspects of livestock production, with the exception of herding and marketing, since these tasks require absence from the home. Activities that women are reported to be active in are feeding and watering, fodder gathering, poultry and rabbit care, stable cleaning, collecting dung for fertilizer and fuel, care of sick, pregnant and lactating animals, milking, ghee/cheese and butter-making, in addition to breeding and selection.
Cash income obtained from women's work in livestock production may be quite high, especially with regard to the sale of milk, cheese, butter and ghee. Equally notable is the nutritional value and protein contributions of these dairy products to the farm household diet.
In countries where pastoral communities rely predominantly on livestock production as their main economic activity, such as in the Islamic Republic of Iran, Pakistan, Somalia and Sudan, women contribute substantially to livestock rearing (primarily sheep, goats, camels and cattle). Pastoral women's responsibilities are mainly centred on milking and watering, as well as on transforming animal products such as wool and hide, into clothes, rugs and tents. It is worth mentioning that the role of women in pastoral societies is becoming increasingly difficult in light of rapid pasture degradation.
Perhaps the only agricultural enterprise that is completely a woman's domain and involves little or no interference from the male members of the family is poultry raising. Although this activity is usually a small-scale home-based occupation, women are nevertheless responsible for the selling of poultry products, and are often the sole decision makers regarding the disposal of income derived from this endeavour. Annex II provides more detailed information about women's roles in livestock production in selected countries of the Near East region.
Women in fisheries and agroforestry
Compared to crop and livestock production, fisheries and agroforestry are not major sources of employment in the Near East region. The proportion of total land area grown to forests is less than 19% in most countries, with the exception of Turkey where 26% is grown to forests, and approximately 6% of the rural population is engaged in fisheries production. Nevertheless, data from the country papers indicates that these sub-sectors are generally male-dominated, and that women play very limited roles in fisheries and agroforestry. In fisheries, some women may be involved in net-making and net maintenance and repair (Egypt, Yemen, Cyprus and Turkey), while women in Egypt, Sudan and Cyprus are engaged in some marketing of fish and fish products. In Morocco, Egypt and Turkey, women are involved to a limited extent in processing fish, while in Mauritania, women process fish for food and medical purposes, as well as assist men in dam and dike building in the Assaba region. A very
small number of women in Egypt participate in fish catching and feeding.
Women's participation in agroforestry is also limited in the region, with the exception of the Sudan, where women are solely responsible for agroforestry, except for the acacia syal tree, where labour is shared with men. In the Islamic Republic of Iran, women are involved in some production and transplanting of seedlings.
Time spent on agricultural/domestic tasks
As indicated earlier, rural women spend many hours every day throughout the year working inside and outside the household as family and/or hired labour, with very little time left for rest or recreation. Although there have been improvements in many rural regions with the introduction of labour-saving technology, such as piped water and gas stoves, women in many countries still spend 10 hours a day or more (up to 19 hours/day, as has been recorded in Morocco) attending to various household and farming chores. In crop production, women work long hours in sowing, transplanting, fertilizing, weeding, thinning, pest control, harvesting, threshing and winnowing, and in many post-harvest activities such as bagging, sorting, grading, cleaning, storage and food processing. Women also spend extensive time in livestock production, such as feeding and watering, fodder gathering, herding, poultry and rabbit care, stable cleaning, collecting dung for fuel and fertilizer, caring for sick
and pregnant or lactating animals, milking, ghee/butter and cheese-making, breeding, selection and marketing. Table 6 summarizes the available data on the number of hours rural women spend in household and agricultural work in selected countries.

Women and agricultural wages
In spite of the fact that most, if not all, Governments in the region have passed legislation stipulating equal rights for men and women in the field of work, including that of equal remuneration, the principle of equal pay for equal work has been difficult to implement, especially with respect to women working in rural areas. A synthesis of the data collected from the country papers indicates that women are paid less than men, often showing that women earn two-thirds or even half of what men earn for the same type of work (Table 7).

Women's decision-making authority at the household level
Very few studies on decision-making at the household level have been conducted in countries of the Near East region. Consequently, it is extremely difficult to make conclusive statements regarding who makes decisions and in which areas. However, since family structures for the majority of the households in the region are male-headed and patriarchal, one could infer that men generally control decision-making, although in many situations, decisions are often made jointly (as in Morocco, for example, where 75% of women surveyed consulted with men prior to attending extension meetings). Women may also have more say than is generally perceived, and exercise significant power in certain family matters relating to marriage, education and divorce, and in other aspects such as child-care and household purchases. Women likewise make important decisions when the household is female-headed (although male relatives may be consulted or make decisions themselves), or when the enterprise is
one in which women predominate, such as poultry, dairy products and kitchen garden produce, as is documented in the country papers of Egypt, Morocco and Turkey.
Moreover, studies have indicated that a woman's negotiating power and her status within the household improves if she is married with children (especially sons) and if she is elderly. Her negotiating power and status are further strengthened if she brings in additional income from activities she performs. In other words, if a woman is working and contributing to household expenditures, her power in the household and her economic worth are enhanced, as is her say in both household and agricultural matters. Thus, any effort to increase the resources and skills available to women in income-generating activities should improve their authority/decision-making power in the household.
Although rural women are heavily involved in almost all aspects of agricultural production, it emerges from the scant data available that their share in decision-making is not commensurate with the amount and type of agricultural work they shoulder. For example, while women are heavily involved in livestock production, with the exception of herding and marketing, decisions related to when to buy or sell, when to vaccinate, feed or water, lie most often with the male members of the household. Decisions regarding field crops such as purchase of inputs, and practices such as when to sow, fertilize, irrigate, weed, harvest and what machinery to use, mainly rest with the men, although women may be physically involved in many of these activities. Furthermore, men appear to have complete control in financial matters such as in credit and loans, marketing and allocation of subsequent generated income, land selling and land rental transactions.
From the data provided in the country papers, women appear to have more decision-making authority in irrigated regions than in rainfed, as documented in the country papers of Iraq, Lebanon and Cyprus. This is predominantly due to the heavy use of agricultural machinery in rainfed areas, and men's control over this machinery.
Since women are often solely responsible for poultry, dairy products and handicrafts, they are the primary decision-makers in issues regarding these enterprises. In Morocco and Egypt, for example, women are responsible for marketing poultry and dairy products. Income derived from these activities is then theirs to spend as they wish, which is usually allocated to household expenditures.

Credit
Special credit facilities for women in the region are limited and only a small number of women farmers apply for loans. Very few institutional arrangements have been made by countries to establish credit lending facilities for rural women. In addition to poor infrastructure, the lack of experience and information, and illiteracy, act as obstacles to receiving agricultural loans from banks or saving associations. A major constraint in women's access to credit is the usual required collateral especially in the form of land ownership. Thus, lending institutions view women as high credit risks as they do not usually own land. Tradition and custom also limit women's control over money matters, especially with regard to the mobility and interaction necessary to access credit facilities. In many countries, women often resort to obtaining credit informally, generally from family members. Annex III provides a synopsis of credit facilities in selected countries offering credit
services to women.
Land
Information on land ownership is very scarce in the region. Indeed, official land ownership records often do not exist in many countries. Furthermore, when the data is available, it is rarely disaggregated by gender. Surveys to collect information directly from farmers should be carefully interpreted, since many tend to under-report for fear of taxation and government control. In spite of these methodological constraints, it appears that women rarely own land in the region, and when they do, the land is often controlled and/or managed by their male relatives until marriage, when the titles are transferred directly to their sons. From the scant data available, it also appears that the average landholding size owned by women is considerably smaller than that owned by men. Table 8 provides data regarding landownership patterns in selected countries of the region.
An analysis of the data available indicates that women seldom exercise their rights regarding landownership. Studies have shown that women often give up their inherited land to their brothers or fathers who, in return, offer them protection from their husbands and husband's family in times of conflict, as well as support in times of need. Often, when their land is being managed by their male relatives, women receive a portion of the land's remittances and/or presents during religious feasts (Taylor 1987; Dresch 1989; Sabir et al. 1989).

Extension
The large majority of extension officers in the region are male and most, if not all, of their target farmers are males. This is because the number of female-headed households is relatively small and because tradition limits interaction between male extension officers and female members of a farming household. Extension to women farmers is often limited to a few qualified and well-trained women extension workers providing training to women in traditional home-based activities such as health, hygiene, nutrition, home management and childcare, and rarely includes on-the-job-training, or information and acquisition of skills in crop and livestock production. Thus, women's access to extension services and information is limited in the region. Table 9 provides information on the percentage of women extension officers and their activities in selected countries. As indicated, the number of women extension officers is extremely small and the scope of their work is severely limited.

Labour-saving technology
Rural women in the region spend long hours every day performing tedious and mostly unpaid labour-intensive and time-consuming agricultural and domestic work. Consequently, there is a real need to develop appropriate technologies for women to reduce their workload in unpaid activities, as well as to increase and improve the quality of their income-generating work.
According to PRA studies and other information generated by the country papers for the region, the use of labour-saving technology (agricultural machinery and tools, transportation facilities, running water, electricity, sewage facilities, kitchens, ovens and fridges, etc.) appears to be gender specific, and has been beneficial to women in some cases but detrimental in others.
In technologies developed for agricultural production, such as mechanized land preparation, sowing, fertilizing, herbicide use, harvesting and post-harvesting activities, men have taken control over these functions, leaving the non-mechanized and more labour-intensive tasks to be performed by women, such as hand-weeding, and vegetable and fruit picking. While mechanization has freed women from performing many tedious operations, it has also replaced an important source of paid labour for a large number of women who depended on these tasks to generate additional income for their families. In addition to mechanization, modern irrigation tools and transportation facilities also appear to be used predominantly by men, as documented in the country papers of Lebanon, Yemen and Egypt.
On the other hand, the increase in the use of home-based technologies such as electricity, piped water, sewage disposal, cooking stoves and cold storage devices, have reduced women's workload by reducing or eliminating the number of trips to collect water and fuel from the outside. These technical advances have also improved household hygiene. In many rural areas, however, these technologies are still not available. In Tunisia, in 1991, 30% of rural households did not have running water and depended on women to carry water to the household. In Morocco, only 3.6% of households have a refrigerator and 10.7% have an electrical or gas oven, and in Syria, only 27% of rural dwellings have indoor sanitary facilities.
To date, labour-saving technologies specifically developed to make women's work more effective in crop and livestock production have not been adequately introduced.
Higher agricultural education
The number of women seeking higher education in agriculture is on the rise in all countries of the region, although female enrolment rates remain considerably lower than males. Women students tend to major in subjects such as food technology and nutrition, agricultural economics and horticulture, while others such as agricultural engineering, animal science and husbandry, fisheries and soil science, remain male-dominated fields.

Women's access to power structures is limited in the region. From the data provided, it is apparent that they hold very few policy-making positions in ministries of agriculture and other ministries. Table 11 provides data on the percentage of women in policy-making positions in ministries of agriculture in selected countries. The highest percentages of women were recorded in the Islamic Republic of Iran, Turkey and Egypt, where women represented 8.7%, 6% and 4.8% of decision-making positions in ministries of agriculture. In Jordan, Syria, Yemen, Mauritania and Cyprus, the percentage of women in decision-making positions was 3.7% or less, while in Iraq and Morocco, the percentage of women at all ministerial levels was 1.0% and 15.5% respectively.

Most countries reported an increase, albeit limited, in women's participation in agricultural cooperatives and rural credit associations, both as members and/or office-bearers. In Iraq, women's membership in cooperatives and rural credit associations increased from 6% to 9.4% between 1980-1990. In 1985, women constituted only 5 % of employees in these organizations. In Jordan, the percentage of women working in cooperatives increased from 21.4% in 1980 to 29.4% in 1993, and women represented 9.3 % of all members in the Farmer's Union in 1993. Of the 38 pastoral associations in Mauritania, 2.6% were presided by women, and in some regions of the country, women organized themselves into numerous cooperatives for vegetable gardening.
In Sudan, women constituted 18% of the decision-making positions in the 11 councils established to manage the agricultural graduate cooperatives set up to employ recently graduated agricultural students. Of the number of office-bearing positions in rural organizations in Cyprus, women held less than 3% of the total. In the Islamic Republic of Iran, in 1994, 9% of all rural cooperative members were women, and in Turkey, women constituted about 1% of total membership in each of the Rural Credit Organizations in Forestry and in the Union of Agricultural Chambers.
WID units in government ministries, autonomous units and organizations
WID units and other machineries to empower women, such as in Government ministries, or autonomous units and organizations, vary considerably among the countries of the region in both number and scope. Some countries, such as Egypt, Sudan, Tunisia and Turkey, have well-established and well-funded units with clear-cut objectives regarding their role in advancing the status of rural women. The majority of countries, however, have only a few WID units with vague and/or limited mandates, and suffer considerably from poor funding and limited access to appropriate human and technical resources. A few countries, such as Egypt, Yemen, Sudan, Iran and Turkey, have established WID units at the upstream level in their ministries of agriculture. These units are entrusted with a number of functions, such as: promoting gender awareness among men and women through gender planning and training; mainstreaming gender-sensitive considerations in agricultural policies and practices; conducting
research and collecting information on women in agriculture (data, documents, etc;.); facilitating women's access to productive resources and services; and coordinating the activities of national and international bodies on issues related to rural women. Annex IV provides a listing of WID units in the countries of the region and a brief summary of their mandates.
NGO support to rural women
Although there are a large number of NGOs operating in the region, their work tends to be concentrated predominantly in urban areas. The number of rural projects and their beneficiaries are most often quite small. The scope of these projects is usually limited to small-scale income generating efforts and educational and vocational training. Very few directly address the needs of women in crop and livestock production, and in developing and/or introducing appropriate technologies for women to alleviate their work burdens. Annex V provides a summary of NGO efforts benefiting rural women in the region.

Lack of awareness of and commitment to internationally and nationally recognized women's rights
Legal instruments available to women in obtaining land, livestock, credit, employment and membership in rural organizations
Activities that have increased men's and women's awareness of women's rights in agriculture
Lack of awareness of and commitment to internationally and nationally recognized women's rights
Legal instruments available to women in obtaining land, livestock, credit, employment and membership in rural organizations
Since the majority of the population in the Near East region is Moslem, a woman's status in society and the legal instruments available to her are subject, more often than not, to a combination of Islamic and civil law. Islamic law, or Shar'ia, gives women explicit economic rights such as ownership of land, livestock and other property, either through purchase or through inheritance. Moslem women have the full right to be involved in economic transactions such as trading and commerce.
Civil law in most countries of the region stipulates that all citizens, irrespective of sex, are treated equally before the law. A number of important laws have been passed in some countries specifically to increase the rights of women and improve their access to education, employment and health, and provide them with legal instruments to obtain land, credit and other productive inputs. However, in spite of these laws, and the fact that there are no major legal handicaps that prevent women from obtaining productive inputs, women continue to have limited access to productive resources and services due mainly to conservative traditions and practices. This is more acute in rural than in urban areas, where stronger and more conservative traditional cultures dominate, and where the ability to enforce the law is more difficult. Consequently, women's access to these inputs remains extremely limited.
Although there are wide variations among the countries of the region, compared to other regions in the world the Near East continues to be among the most conservative regarding women's rights. According to FAO (1995), 16 countries in the region have yet to sign or ratify the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW). Only three countries ratified the Convention (Cyprus, Malta and Yemen), while Tunisia, Egypt, Libya, Iraq and Turkey ratified CEDAW with reservations. Jordan and Afghanistan signed it without ratification.
Table 12 provides a summary of legal actions taken in some countries in support of rural women to improve their access to land, livestock, credit, employment and membership in rural organizations.

Activities that have increased men's and women's awareness of women's rights in agriculture
In addition to legislation, a small number of activities in some countries were carried out to increase the public's awareness of women's roles in agriculture and their legal rights as producers and equal members of society. In Lebanon, for instance, a publication by the Lebanese Association for Human Rights in 1994, entitled "Your Rights at Work", was distributed to the urban and rural public as part of a media campaign to promote the rights of women. Within this context, centres will be established in the rural areas to deal with legal complaints brought forth by women farmers. In the Sudan, a number of national fore, workshops and conferences were also organized for this purpose.
In 1984, in Cyprus, a World Food Day was dedicated to rural women to publicize their important contribution to food production. Furthermore, the Permanent Central Agency set up a Special Committee on Rural Women in cooperation with other agencies and NGOs to discuss issues on women's rights. In the rural areas, the work of this committee included the organization of a seminar and a number of meetings with rural women and women's cooperatives. In the Islamic Republic of Iran, the rights of women in agriculture were the subject of a number of lectures, radio and television programmes. Cross-country trips to meet with rural women were sponsored by the Women's Affairs Office. Women's rights were also discussed in school curricula and the Literacy Campaign's teaching programme. Finally, special training courses were organized for rural welfare employees to acquaint them with women's rights.

Evaluation of innovative programmes, projects and initiatives in support of women in agriculture, forestry and fisheries
Evaluation of innovative programmes, projects and initiatives in support of women in agriculture, forestry and fisheries
While a number of useful programmes, projects and initiatives in support of rural women were carried out in the region, few could actually be considered "innovative" per se. Many could perhaps be described as "innovative" simply because they were the first initiatives carried out to support women in agriculture, forestry and fishery enterprises. With the exception of a few, most other initiatives could be classified as (a) projects that provide direct assistance to women (credit, technology, inputs, etc. ); (b) projects that seek to strengthen institutional support for women (cooperatives, WID units, etc.), and (c) policy planning and research activities (collection of gender disaggregated data and studies to identify the role of women in agricultural production, etc.).
As can be seen from Annex VI, there is a felt need for additional concerted and creative efforts by governmental, non-governmental and international agencies to improve the existing situation, and translate some of the "rhetoric" into concrete programmes of action.

Review and appraisal of international support
Review and appraisal of international support
A review and appraisal of international support for rural women in the Near East region indicates that a large proportion of the efforts remain small-scale, localized, and isolated. Project follow-up and post-project evaluation do not appear to be basic components of project development and design.
The vast majority of international projects seek to improve the lives of women by: (a) targeting educational, health and family planning needs, and (b) providing training and inputs for women's traditional small-scale rural enterprises, such as weaving and animal husbandry. While these efforts are commendable, stronger support and more forward-looking approaches are needed to alleviate the excessive work burdens of rural women, increase the productivity of their labour, generate a more equal distribution of benefits, and improve the general standard of living. Annex VII provides a review and appraisal of international support as listed in the country papers.

Future strategic goals and objectives and corresponding financial arrangements
Future strategic goals and objectives and corresponding financial arrangements
An overall analysis was made of the respective countries' strategic goals and objectives (Annex VIII). Most of the countries indicated the need to avoid fragmented, short-term, under-invested, low-impact initiatives, and instead adopt a strong, action-oriented regional framework for the implementation of priority programmes through the use of a participatory people-centred approach. Within this context, emphasis was placed on the following critical areas, which have been consistently reiterated in the country papers:
 Improve policy-focused information, including the provision of sufficient, timely and accurate quantitative and qualitative gender-disaggregated data as well as indicators of women's roles and status, to gain a more accurate view of the existing conditions and contributions, constraints, needs and aspirations of rural women;
 Improve institutional support and capacity building (such as establishing WID units and other coordinating WID bodies with adequate human and financial resources within the ministries of agriculture), and enhance the role of NGOs and international support, etc.;
 Increase gender sensitization activities, planning and training;
 Mainstream gender issues into the planning, policy and implementation process of the agricultural sector;
 Increase the representation of women at the decision-making level and open up new and innovative horizons for them;
 Improve rural women's access to, and control over, productive resources and support services (land, water, credit, information, extension, training, acquisition of skills, input supply, market opportunities, etc.) within an enabling policy and institutional environment;
 Provide time and energy-saving technology and technical know-how to help ease the drudgery of the workload of rural women, especially in livestock production, backyard gardening, post-harvest activities and food processing, which could be linked with the enhancement of research capabilities to identify appropriate technologies and functional measures to implement necessary activities;
 Increase income-earning rural enterprises in on-farm and off-farm activities;
 Provide technical training, especially to young rural women, in various fields outside the traditional agricultural sector, such as agro-industry, commerce, manufacturing and services;
 Develop conceptual and practical guidelines in the area of rural women and sustainable development (with special attention to gender, environment and population);
 Increase networking, people's participation, cooperatives, farmers unions, community development organizations, and the use of participatory mechanisms and tools;
 Improve institutional capacity to meet the fundamental needs of rural women (education, health, nutrition, social insurance, etc.); and,
 Improve/change negative stereotype images of rural women by promoting linkages with various organs of the mass media.
RPAWANE 2000 is expected to respond to some of these issues, in cooperation with other interested partners. These issues have been grouped into four complementary and mutually reinforcing areas for action:
 Collection, analysis and dissemination of gender-disaggregated statistical data;
 Institutional support and capacity building;
 Women in agriculture and sustainable development (with emphasis on gender, environment and population); and,
 Networking and people's participation.

Country
Role of Women in Crop Production
Cyprus
Women's participation in crop production has increased as a result of male migration to urban areas to seek employment. Men and women are equally responsible for the production of potatoes, citrus, vines, greenhouse vegetables, pulses and deciduous fruit crops. Women are responsible for planting, pruning, grafting, harvesting and processing grapes. Women are involved in the sowing, planting, irrigating and spraying of many crops as well as in feed preparation.
Egypt
According to a special sample survey carried out in four governorates, women are active in all aspects of crop production, with the exception of land preparation and pest control. Women work in both subsistence and cash crop production, and contribute 50% of the work in seed treatment and harvesting of peanuts, and 50% of the work required in the cultivation of potatoes, tomatoes, broad beans, lentils, peanuts and soybeans. In the production of wheat, maize, rice and berseem (clover), women are involved in storage and marketing.
Iran
The extent to which women participate in crop production in Iran depends primarily on farm size. Women from poor and small land-holdings are more actively engaged in crop production than women from larger and richer farms. The increase in the use of mechanization has also altered the nature of women's participation in crop production. As agricultural land is consolidated into larger plots to make mechanization more economically feasible and to increase efficiency and output, women's traditional roles in sowing, fertilizing and harvesting have been replaced by an increase in their involvement in post-harvest activities such as processing, cleaning and storage. Compared to other crops, women's share of labour is greatest in rice cultivation.
Iraq
Women are responsible for weeding and post-harvest processing.
Jordan
Female wage labourers plant, weed, thin, fertilize, pick, harvest and pack.
Lebanon
Women are responsible for sowing, weeding, harvesting and processing. It appears that women's workloads are greater in non-irrigated than in irrigated areas, due to poorer economic standards in non-irrigated areas. Women are involved in seed preparation, planting, irrigating, weeding and harvesting of tobacco, and in many aspects of fruit and olive tree growing and vegetable greenhouse production.
Mauritania
Women are involved in sowing, weeding, plant protection, maintenance, harvesting, food preparation, storage, preservation, treatment and marketing of crops. In rice production, women provide inputs only, while in dates production, women irrigate, maintain, pack, store and market.
Country
Role of Women in Crop Production .
Morocco
The extent of women's participation in crop production depends on the season. According to data gathered in 1986-87, women are responsible for 34.8% of the work associated with cereal, legume and fodder production, compared to 39.5% of that relating to livestock production. A study conducted for RPAWANE 2000 in Morocco showed that women's participation was greater in livestock production (67.8%) than in crop production (46.2%), and that women in marginal rainfed regions worked more in crop production than in irrigated zones and the favourable rainfed areas. In all three zones, women worked similar hours in cleaning, weeding, harvesting and storing, while their involvement in sowing, irrigating, pest control and fertilizing depended on the zones in which they worked and on the crops themselves. Furthermore, the RPAWANE 2000 study showed that the overall percentage of women's participation was 41% in crop production and 51.8% in livestock production, although these percentages
varied according to zone.
Oman
Women's participation in crop production has increased significantly as a result of male migration to urban areas. According to PRA interviews, women are responsible for weeding, packing, processing (drying), threshing and storage, while men are responsible for seedbed preparation, planting, fertilizing, pest control and marketing.
Somalia
According to a study in 1984 of the Bay Region, women and men share crop production activities. For example, in banana production, which is the main cash crop and second largest export commodity in the country, women fertilize and transport bananas to packing centres, while men irrigate and harvest the banana crop. Women are also responsible for the marketing of mango, potato, lemon, watermelon, vegetables and firewood to supplement their family income.
Sudan
Men often seek off-farm employment in urban areas, while women are left behind to do all crop production activities. A baseline survey conducted by the Ministry of Agriculture in 1989 showed that women were responsible for land clearing and preparation, seed treatment, sowing, harvesting, transporting, as well as pest control.
Syria
Women are involved in all labour-intensive crop production activities such as sowing, thinning and weeding.
Tunisia
Women are active in many crop production activities such as hoeing, weeding, harvesting, threshing and processing, especially in regions with heavy male out-migration.
Country
Role of Women in Crop Production
Turkey
The extent of women's participation in crop production is a function of farm size and farming system. On large agricultural enterprises that rely heavily on mechanization, women from landless families are involved in various labour-intensive tasks as wage labourers. On , medium-sized farms, women do labour-intensive work to complement the mechanized work carried out by men. On small-sized farms, women have predominant responsibility in all aspects of crop production, as men from these farms often seek off-farm employment. Thus, according to a study in Erzurum, the role of women is greatest on small farms, which rely mostly on unpaid women's work for , crop production. Furthermore, the role of women in regions that grow traditional crops such as wheat and barley has diminished due to , mechanization, while their role in cash crop production has increased, such as in cotton production in southern Turkey. In the eastern , region of the country where dryland farming is
practiced, women work an average of 45 days per year in agriculture, devoting most of , their time to livestock production. ,
Yemen
Women are responsible for 53% of all the work required in agricultural production. Approximately 40% and 20% of all the work needed , in vegetable and fruit production is provided by women, respectively.

Role of Women in Livestock Production
Cyprus
Women have primary responsibility for livestock production, constituting 45 % of all work needed in this domain. With the exception of shearing, women are responsible for all other activities such as milking, cleaning and feeding animals, and in cheese-making and the production of other dairy products.
Egypt
According to a PRA study of 50 families in the governorate of Dakahlia in 1994, women were more active than men in milking, and in the marketing and processing of milk and animal products. While a large number of surveyed farms indicated that they consumed a portion of the milk and milk products which they produced, all households that kept farm animals sold most of the calf meat for income.
Iran
In spite of a growing commercial poultry and livestock industry, women remain active in small-scale poultry and egg production, as well as in raising and feeding farm animals used for traction, meat, dairy products and wool.
Iraq
Livestock production is shared between men and women.
Lebanon
All activities relating to livestock production, with the exception of health care and marketing, are women's responsibility. About 80% of animal products are for home consumption, with the exception of some milk, which is often sold to neighbours.
Mauritania
Watering of livestock is mainly carried out by men. Women are responsible for milk processing and transforming milk into by-products, and in tanning hides and leather-making. About 70% of the work relating to raising cows, birds and poultry, is carried out by women.
Morocco
With the exception of marketing, women are involved in all aspects of livestock production, and their roles appear to vary according to zone. Women in marginal rainfed areas have a greater responsibility for livestock production than their counterparts in favourable rainfed areas or irrigated areas. In marginal rainfed areas, women and girls are responsible for feeding, watering and cleaning sheep pens, while in irrigated zones, women and men share the responsibility in feeding. About 10% of women in this zone are involved in marketing livestock.
Domestic animal husbandry is the most important economic activity for women in rural Morocco. Women are in charge of feeding, maintenance, milking and butter-making. Approximately 77%, 76%, 43% and 81% of all women surveyed were active in dairy, sheep, goat and bird husbandry, respectively, and 70%, 39%, 74% and 76% of the work needed in dairy, sheep, goat and bird husbandry is provided by women, respectively. Moreover, according to an RRA study conducted in 1994, the majority of primary and secondary animal products are used for commercial, rather than for domestic purposes. In spite of women's heavy involvement in livestock production, it is usually the men who own livestock, with the exception of 10% of women in irrigated zones.

Syria
Women are responsible for all activities relating to livestock production, such as milking, feeding, watering and cleaning barns, while men are responsible for vaccination and trimming.
Turkey
Women are responsible for feeding and watering livestock, as well as for milking and processing. Men are responsible for herding, marketing, gathering fodder and health care, with the exception of goats, whose health is the concern of women and men jointly. Men and women market cattle and goats, whereas men are responsible for marketing sheep. Women are also responsible for all aspects of poultry production such as feeding, watering and processing by-products, with the exception of poultry health, which is the concern of men. Men have primary responsibility for bee-keeping, with the exception of processing by-products, which are tasks carried out by women. Finally, women are responsible for all aspects of sericulture, with the exception of marketing, which is carried out by men.
Yemen
Women herd cows, while both men and women herd sheep and goats. Approximately 88% of the work required for livestock production is carried out by women. Women gather fodder, feed, water, milk, and are involved in health care, while men are primarily involved in livestock marketing.

Annex III: Women's access to credit
Annex III: Women's access to credit
Country
Women's Access to Credit
Cyprus
Of the total number of agricultural loans disbursed in the last decade, approximately 25%-28% have been granted to rural women.
Egypt
The establishment of the Principal Bank for Development and Agricultural Credit has encouraged women to make use of available credit by setting up special funds for women farmers. In 1993, the percentage of women who obtained credit was quite small. Compared to men, women constituted 12% of all short-term production loans and 16% of investment loans. Women in rural Egypt may also obtain credit from agricultural cooperative societies.
Iran
The Agricultural Bank extends credit to women carpet weavers and women members of rural cooperatives. In 1993, women received 15% of all loans disbursed by the Bank.
Iraq
Credit is made available only from the State Bank of Agriculture. Women's applications for credit are low compared to men. Although cooperatives do not offer cash loans, they do provide members with agricultural inputs such as seeds, fertilizers, herbicides, pesticides, veterinary services and access to machinery at no charge. However, female membership in these cooperatives is low (9.4% in the 1980s).
Jordan
Credit is made available at the Agricultural Credit Corporation. In 1993, 6% of total loans were disbursed to women. At the Agricultural Credit Organization, only 4.6% of its clients were women, and women constituted only 3.4% of the agricultural and agro-industrial loans disbursed by the Development and Employment Fund in 1993.
Lebanon
Due to the civil war, access to credit by men and women farmers has been extremely limited in Lebanon. Since the majority of cooperative members are men, women rarely benefitted from cooperative loans. Some NGOs have established short and medium-term loan programmes for rural women.
Mauritania
Women do not have access to loans from credit facilities. However, they can obtain loans from informal saving clubs (tontines).
Morocco
Although no gender-disaggregated data is available from the Caisse National de Credit Agricole (CNCA), the main lending institution for rural activities in Morocco, a pilot study showed that special arrangements for women can increase their application rate. In this pilot zone, women clients increased from 400 to 2,000. As a result, the CNCA is examining ways to put these special arrangements into general use throughout the country.
Oman
Women's access to credit services remains low compared to men's. Since the establishment of the Oman Bank for Agriculture and Fisheries in 1981, only IS loans to date have been granted to women.
Country
Women's Access to Credit
Pakistan
Only a small number of women receive loans from the Agricultural Development Bank of Pakistan. The First Women's Bank was established in 1989 by the Government in order to cater to women's needs by providing small loans on low collateral, and the majority of the bank's employees are women. Although the bank has 29 branches all over the country, only 5% of the total amount of loans have been disbursed to rural women. Efforts are currently underway to encourage rural women to apply for credit.
Sudan
The Agricultural Bank of the Sudan (ABS) finances women's cooperatives with the objective of extending credit to women farmers to produce sesame, millet and karkadi. ABS also provides credit for special projects in some regions the country. For example, the Bank's Deling Branch began providing loans to purchase machinery and production inputs in 1988/1989 for a Nuba Mountain Rural Development Project, and the majority of beneficiaries were women. In the El Nuhud Cooperative Credit project, ABS and the Agricultural Extension and Cooperative Department extended credit to women farmers in agricultural societies for sesame, groundnut and gum arabic production.
The Livestock Bank, established in 1993, extends credit for dairy, poultry and fishery production. Of the 989 and 1200 loans disbursed to cooperatives for dairy and poultry production, 45 and 71 were disbursed to women cooperatives, respectively.
Syria
There is no gender-disaggregated data regarding loans from agricultural banks. In general, however, only 30% of all rural families obtain loans from banks. Since women comprised only 7.2% of total membership in agricultural cooperatives in 1990, it is assumed that very few of these women benefitted from the credit and other services offered.
Turkey
While women's share of total deposits at the Agricultural Bank amounted to 26.3% of the total, women comprised only 2.8% of the total loans disbursed.
Yemen
Very few women have access to credit.

Annex VI: Innovative programmes, projects and initiatives in support of rural women
Cyprus:
 In the period 1979-1990, three studies on the role of women in agriculture and rural development were carried out in order to: (i) highlight rural women's roles and their impact on social and economic life; (ii) identify needs, constraints and possibilities in channelling assistance to rural women, as well as key areas for future action; and, (iii) provide assistance in reviewing and strengthening on-going training programmes in the Home Economics Unit.
 The Home Economics Programme was revised to include training in agricultural activities especially designed for women. Home Economics officers assumed the role of intermediaries to establish communication channels with rural women.
 A project to encourage women's access to improved small-scale industries for the processing of agricultural and livestock products was established by the Department of Agriculture at the Ministry of Agriculture, Natural Resources and Environment. This project aimed at providing financial assistance and support to women farmers strengthening women's participation in obtaining loans and credit, and increasing family income.
Egypt:
A number of innovative programmes, projects and initiatives in support of women in agriculture were implemented in Egypt between 1980-1993, which include the following:
 The Agricultural Production and Credit Project, implemented by the Ministry of Agriculture. This project sought to provide a rapid low cost source of credit for women. Women benefitted from credit and were trained in improved and modern production methods, and in marketing activities. Women also conducted their own income generating schemes which increased their income levels. However, women did not exceed 12% of the total borrowers for short-term production loans, and 16% for investment loans in 1993.
 Biogas and Efficient Use of Agricultural Residues. Women were trained in biogas technology and its efficient application.
 Improved Manufacturing of Salt Cheese. Women were trained in using modern technological methods, which increased cheese production and income for women.
 Introduction of Appropriate Technologies in Olive Processing. Women were introduced to technologies to produce high quality olive oil and olive pickles.
 A Complete Small Poultry Production Unit for Small Farmers. Through training and demonstrations, technology was introduced to women to increase eggs and poultry production, which increased income and consumption.
 Rabbit Production Package for Small Farmers. The project aimed to increase high protein food and income from marketing.
 Development of Basic Life Skills of Village Women. Up-to-date technology for food production was introduced. The target of the project was to adopt new concepts in nutrition and food habits. The project led to the formation of new skills, increased income, new nutritional patterns, and created work opportunities and small-scale investment enterprises for food production. The project also supported the training of women extension officers and women leaders.
Iran:
 The Council of Coordination of Rural Women's Activities was established at the Women's Affairs Office. Members of the Council are representatives from organizations active in rural affairs and at the village level. The first activity of the Council was to coordinate the publication of various materials aimed to give women information in agriculture, public health, law matters, etc.
 Office for the Development of Rural Women's Activities was established to plan and implement activities concerning the advancement of rural women. It's headquarters is in Tehran, with its agents (rural women extension officers) located in the provinces.
 Rural Women's Cooperatives were established by the Ministry of Agriculture in 1992 in conjunction with the Central Rural Cooperatives Organization. Currently, there are five active women's cooperatives which will be extended to 25 provinces. In these cooperatives, women learn to discuss and evaluate problems which they face to arrive at proper solutions.
 The Imam Khomeini Relief Committee's Plans aims to assist poor and elderly women in rural regions throughout the country.
Iraq:
 In the 1976-1979 period, GFIW organized a number of rural campaigns to raise the awareness of women's legal rights and the importance of female education and health, and women's full participation in socio-economic activities.
 In 1972, GFIW established a Women's Farm completely managed by women. GFIW assisted women in obtaining subsidized agricultural inputs and credit. In addition to land grown to vegetables, the farm also included several livestock rearing sheds, nine poultry houses and a bee-keeping unit. The farm currently operates as a mini-modern village, with a literacy centre and social, educational, health and agricultural extension services. The project was later handed over to the Ministry of Agriculture. In 1987, the Women's Farm joined the General Federation of Farmer's Cooperatives. Currently, 180 farmers (half of whom are women), participate in this initiative. In 1987, a cooperative for cottage industries was incorporated in the farm (to sew women's and children's clothing), and women are paid by output and by annual profit shares.
Jordan:
 The Queen Alia Fund sponsored six innovative agricultural projects for women with 310 beneficiaries. Three of these projects were in animal production sheep husbandry, milk products, and domestic bird processing. The remaining three were in plant production medicinal plants, palm forest project and home gardening project.

A Rabbit Husbandry Project with 30 women beneficiaries; Sheep Husbandry and Dairy Products with 10 families as beneficiaries; Bee Husbandry Project with 70 families as beneficiaries; Life Developing Project with 600 families as beneficiaries.
Lebanon:
With the exception of the Ministry of Social Affairs, Lebanon lacks well-defined units to address the needs of rural women.
 Prior to the civil war in 1975, the Ministry was active in social welfare centres which provided informal training to rural women in health and education.
 In the past five years, the Faculty of Agricultural Sciences at the Lebanese University has been active in providing specialized extension services to women farmers.
 The Village Welfare Society conducted four pioneering projects in Mount Lebanon which targeted rural women: (i) in 1973, an agricultural cooperative was established to assist women farmers to purchase inputs at subsidized costs, obtain credit and extension services and assistance in marketing; (ii) Annual Agricultural Exhibitions, where women marketed their produce; (iii) established a training centre for women in areas such as bee-keeping and poultry production; and, (iv) established literacy programmes and training women to acquire a diploma in agricultural social work. While these projects were very successful for the most part, they were discontinued due to the civil war.
 The Lebanon Family Planning Association is an NGO active in training women at the community level to become social workers. Women were selected from various villages and trained in rural sociology, family planning, primary health care, vocational training and food processing.
Mauritania:
 Project for the Advancement of Women was established by the Ministry of Rural Development and the Environment in cooperation with FAO. The objectives of this project were to: (i) develop a methodology for gender analysis; (ii) develop a plan of action to integrate women in rural development; and, (iii) undertake budget-time surveys on women's activities in rural areas.

The main objectives are to: (i) elaborate a national strategy and plans of action for the advancement of women; (ii) provide training of the State Secretariat for Women's Cadres; (iii) establish a monitoring system on women's status, a documentation centre and a databank; and, (iv) reinforce cooperation between different technical departments and donors.
Morocco:
 Ministry of Agriculture programmes for women are relatively recent in Morocco. In the last decade, emphasis was placed on research to assess women's situation in agriculture, and to identify their constraints and needs. Currently, a strategy to establish intervention mechanisms, train personnel and conduct sensitization campaigns is being developed. One of the most original components of the strategy is the integration of social and population aspects to extension activities. Most agricultural projects at the Ministry are beginning to include a women's component.
 Ministry of Youth and Sports Programmes. This Ministry has a network of 360 women's units, half of which are located in rural areas. These units are focal points for women's education, family planning, income-generating activities and the creation of women's cooperatives. The Ministry also has 277 kindergartens, 45 % of which are located in rural areas. The lack of resources is the major problem facing these units.
 Ministry of Employment and Social Affairs Programme. This Ministry has 300 socio-educational centres providing education to mothers. Two-thirds of these centres are located in the rural areas. It also has 458 Education and Work centres, of which half are located in rural Morocco. These centres train young women in sewing and embroidery, and provide training in functional literacy and income generating activities.
 Ministry of Education Programmes conduct campaigns to encourage parents to send their daughters to school. Currently, the Ministry is in the process of elaborating reforms to encourage the education of girls.
 The National Union of Moroccan Women (NUMW) is the most active NGO in rural areas with 550 regional units and 120 local ones. The Union established 15 women's cooperatives to implement income-generating projects for women in crop and livestock production.
Oman:
 A number of projects have sought to create income generating activities for rural women in the past decade. These were initiated by women's associations and production groups with full technical assistance and some financial support from the Ministry of Social Affairs.
 Social Development Programme. This programme included training courses in income-generating activities such as tailoring, sewing, embroidery, weaving, spinning and incense-mixing for women community development workers and women local leaders.
Pakistan:
 The Aga Khan Rural Support Programme, established in 1982, aimes at promoting rural development through the organization of communities for both women and men. Approximately 571 women's organizations have been formed with 19,600 women members. These organizations developed an efficient credit system as members collectively saved to provide joint collateral for credit. A common method used to increase savings has been to collectively cultivate a village plot and place the earnings in a common savings fund. The success of this model has resulted in its replication in the form of a National Rural Support Programme.
 In 1990, The Aurat Foundation, a national NGO, in collaboration with other NGOs and with support from UNIFEM, organized a gathering of rural women. In this gathering, rural women expressed their concerns regarding their heavy workload, as well as highlighted areas in which they needed community and governamental support. In 1992, a second regional conference took place with the participation of women from Bangladesh, India, Nepal and Pakistan. A third gathering took place in Pakistan in 1993 and was attended by 103 rural women.
Somalia:
 Women Farming Families Project, funded and implemented by GTZ, FAO, and the agricultural extension project (AFMET). The project aimed to increase agricultural production by providing training to women farmers in agriculture and agroforestry, and to improve women's access to credit in cash and kind. The project increased awareness regarding the importance of trees for rural women's work by creating commercial village nurseries, and assisted women by reducing the time allocated to wood gathering for fuel and collecting fodder for livestock. The project lasted from July 1988 to October 1989, and had to be discontinued due to the civil war.

Turkey:
 The Area Based Services for Children and Mothers in the Priority Provinces Project was launched by UNICEF and the Turkish Government for the period 1991-1995. The programme mobilized community members to achieve social and economic development through "women's groups" organized at the village level. The project aims to enhance social development and create and increase social demands for services while mobilizing community resources in support of such services. A set of integrated activities have been initiated, include the development of social infrastructure through education oriented activities (reducing illiteracy of girls and women), and mobilizing, creating and strengthening women's groups and women's houses. Women's groups are organized by provincial education and agricultural directorates. Women's houses have been established through the use of local material and physical input provided by the villagers. The houses are used to improve communication among women, and
provide basic health, nutrition and consciousness-raising courses and activities.

Annex VII: Review and appraisal of international support
Cyprus:
 Rural women in Cyprus have not benefited from any international assistance specifically targeted to them.
Egypt:
 In cooperation with FAO, in 1992 the Policy and Coordination Unit for Women in Agriculture (PCUWA) at the Ministry of Agriculture began to examine and coordinate technical cooperation programmes in Egypt. The Unit works at the "upstream" level and promotes gender sensitization at various levels.
 Several projects were implemented by the Ministry of Agriculture and the Ministry of Social Affairs, with financial and technical support from international organizations such as FAO, ILO, Dutch Aid Programme, UNFPA and UNICEF. The projects' objectives have included: training in health, education, nutrition, family planning and literacy, and the establishment of day-care centres as well as women's development centres for income generating activities. One project aimed at providing loans to women farmers and another provided training to women in food industry and breeding of poultry, ducks and sheep.
While all projects contributed to the increase of women's income, the projects' contributions to family planning, education, child health care services and participation in collective work was generally low.
Iran:
 Appointment of a female national coordinator at the Ministry of Agriculture to coordinate FAO activities in advancing rural women in Iran.
 Collaborative activities between UNICEF and the Ministry of Health, Medical Care and Education have been carried out to encourage family planning and breastfeeding, and provide education and healthcare training to newly literate rural women. UNICEF was also involved in a Women and Development Programme that focused on the role of women in society and development. Finally, UNICEF collaborated with the Ministry of Agriculture in organizing a workshop on "Gender Analysis" for extension officers, and carried out a study in the northern provinces to assess the degree of coordination among the various institutions providing services to rural women.
 UNFPA is currently collaborating with the Ministry of Agriculture to expand and strengthen rural women's cooperatives.
Iraq:
A very low level of international aid and cooperation was devoted to address issues relevant to rural women prior to the Gulf War. Since then, international assistance has ceased due to the United Nations boycott of Iraq. In the 1982-86 period, only the following two internationally supported projects have targeted rural women:
 In cooperation with FAO, the Ministry of Agriculture in 1985 embarked on an integrated rural development project in the marshland areas.
 In cooperation with GFIW, UNICEF worked on a Rural Mother and Child Health project. The objectives of the project included reducing infant mortality, training mothers to recognize diseases, providing vaccination to children on time, post-natal care, breastfeeding, nutrition and hygiene.
Jordan:
 An income diversification project was sponsored by IFAD and the Arab Fund and implemented by the Ministry of Agriculture in 1993. The project aimed at distributing sheep, goats and seeds, and at providing a mechanism for the distribution of dairy and plant products. Special emphasis was placed on assisting female-headed households.
Lebanon:
The following projects are currently underway in the Beqaa region, where women play a significant role in agriculture:
 An integrated rural development project, implemented by the Ministry of Agriculture and funded by several UN agencies. Beginning in 1994, this project sought to involve women in socio-economic development and eliminate illicit crop cultivation by improving women's access to credit for household projects. The project has also trained women in cottage industries, and appointed a woman development specialist to facilitate the implementation of projects for women.
 A Small Holder Livestock Rehabilitation Project, funded by IFAD, OPEC Fund for International Development and the Lebanese Government, is scheduled to commence in 1994. The project aims to improve livestock production, rehabilitate extension services, and increase income for poor farmers, especially women. Women will be provided with credit and training by female extension officers.
Mauritania: A project in Gender Methodology at the Ministry of Rural Development, in collaboration with FAO, aimed at establishing a plan of action to integrate women in the development process. Since 1985, several projects have been sponsored by UNDP to promote extension for women, and establish women's cooperatives. Although UNFPA stresses a women's component in each development project, this effort has usually been limited to family planning and child health care. UNFPA is currently involved in a media campaign project with the Ministry of Women's Affairs, which focuses primarily on women's legal rights.
Morocco:
 UNDP supported the establishment of a WID unit at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Cooperation, as well as a study on the status of women in Morocco in 1994. In Cooperation with FAO, several projects were implemented in rural Morocco in nutrition and the establishment and support of a women's NGO and rural women's cooperatives. Several projects were also sponsored by UNICEF, which targeted girls and women in deprived regions in the areas of hygiene and child-mother health. In addition, UNICEF sponsored a study in six provinces on the capacities, attitudes and practices of women facing problems of development.
Pakistan:
 Most UN funded and/or bilateral WID projects, or agricultural projects with WID components, revolved around the training of women in storage, preservation and potato seed preparation skills. Income generation projects included training women in setting up poultry farms, goat husbandry and vegetable gardening.
 FAO was involved in the training of rural women in income generating activities in agriculture, and increased women's access to improved seeds, fruit-drying techniques and information and skills related to plant disease control. Multinational donors, under the leadership of UNIFEM, have supported systematic efforts to conduct gender sensitization by developing a national team of trainers with knowledge in gender awareness/sensitization and gender analysis. The Embassy of the Netherlands supported a project to train female extension officers in livestock, as well as fruit and vegetable growing and preservation.
Sudan:
 Several projects benefiting rural women have been implemented through UNDP funding, Technical Cooperation Programmes, Trust Funds and Government Cooperation programmes. Some efforts have included: training women to crop twice in a flood irrigation system; developing a demonstration farm to highlight the importance of extension in training women farmers and in upgrading their skills; providing women with fuel wood to reduce their drudgery as well as safeguard the environment; and, providing training to professional women in rural development.
Although the number of projects targeting rural women in the Sudan have increased since 1985, much more assistance is needed to improve women's roles in agricultural production, strengthen women's machineries by institution-building, and improve women's access to productive resources. Special technical assistance is needed in extension and training to target women farmers.
Syria:
 The Syrian Government, in cooperation with The Arab Fund, is implementing an eight-year agricultural development project in southern Syria, financed by IFAD, The Arab Fund, UNDP and the Syrian Government (total budget is US$41.2 million). Target beneficiaries include 17,600 families in 150 poor villages and 60,000 rural women. Specific objectives include: development of rocky land; strengthen extension activities in crop, livestock production and women's activities; provide education and develop skills for women; and develop livestock activities, create income-generating activities for women and improve their nutritional status.
Tunisia:
 Credit, training and extension services will be extended to women within the scope of two large scale projects to be implemented in Tunisia with FAO. The first project is aimed at 10,000 rural households, while the second at 400,000 hectares of rural land.
Turkey:
 In cooperation with the Ministry of Agriculture, WFP supported a project to provide vocational training to rural women in the poor mountain villages in the 1992-1994 period. Women were trained in carpet weaving and home economics. The "Giresun Beekeeping Project", supported by FAO for the NFTW Foundation, aimed at encouraging women's involvement in bee-keeping, which is predominantly a male task in Turkey. Poor village women were provided with credit, training, and other support mechanisms for this activity. The second phase seeks to establish a women's cooperative. The Women Farmers Extension Project (1991-1995) aims to improve the existing home economics extension services in order to increase rural women's efficiency and contribution to food production. Two FAO projects in forestry and geese-raising are currently being implemented to increase women's participation in their management, and to contribute to women's income.
Yemen:
Although all international agricultural technical support programmes usually incorporate a rural women's component, very little benefit has accrued for the following reasons:
 Lack of funding
 Funding for women's component is used for other purposes
 Credit from Agricultural Cooperative Bank is not available for women
 Women agricultural graduates are not encouraged to work in rural areas
 Research results are rarely applied
 Lack of modern infrastructure services such as clean water and gas for cooking
 Lack of a cooperative society to market rural handicrafts and other products
