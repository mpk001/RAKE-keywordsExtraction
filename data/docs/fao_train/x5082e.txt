<title>The rabbit husbandry, health and production</title>
<section>1</section>
Foreword
A plague for some, a panacea for others, the rabbit has been the subject of a general revival of interest since the 1960s. This animal was domesticated rather recently compared to other farm animals, and systematic research on rabbit meat production has only been undertaken in the last two decades.
The rabbit occupies a niche midway between ruminants and monogastric animals. It can utilize cellulose-rich feed, and can still produce satisfactorily with a ration containing as little as 20 percent of grain. The rabbit accordingly competes less directly with man for food than do hogs or poultry. This is a fundamental point given the fact that most developing countries are now importing grain to feed people. The rabbit's biological characteristics-its short life cycle, its prolificacy and feed conversion capacity-make it, immediately after chickens and turkeys, the best animal protein machine.
Finally, rabbits are especially well adapted to backyard rearing systems in which capital and fodder resources are usually limiting factors in animal production. When rabbits are reared according to the techniques appropriate to the environment they can do much to improve the family diet of many of the most needy rural families, while at the same time supplying them with a source of income. With more advanced technology rabbit production can also help to supply big city meat markets.
Of course rabbit cannot be eaten by certain peoples for religious reasons, but the more usual motive for rejecting rabbit meat is ignorance. Rabbit meat is in fact very bland, and can be prepared in a great variety of ways. Nutritionally speaking, it is one of the very best meats.
Considering the interest in rabbit breeding displayed by many FAO member countries, this seemed the right time to bring together as fully and objectively as possible all the data available on the subject. This monograph is also intended to help technical experts and extension workers devise and carry out rabbit development programmes.
Wherever the information was available developing country problems have been stressed, especially tropical problems. Still, we recognize that a great deal of research remains to be done before these are solved.
A team of scientists from the Institut national de la recherche agronomique (INRA), a world-renowned rabbit authority, was marshalled to cover the many and varied aspects of rabbit production for this publication. Led by Francois Lebas, Director of INRA's Rabbit Research Laboratory in Toulouse, the team featured among its main authors:
Pierre Coudert, Rabbit Diseases Laboratory, INRA. Tours Centre;
Roger Rouvier, Animal Genetics Improvement Station, INRA, Toulouse Centre;
Hubert de Rochambeau, Department of Animal Production . Institut national agronomique, Paris-Grignon, Paris Centre.
The main focus of the work of these authors has been on intensifying production in industrial-scale rabbitries in temperate climates, but these men have also had the opportunity of dealing directly with problems of developing rabbit production in Third World countries.
FAO expresses its thanks to the full INRA team and all the volunteer helpers whose work made possible the publication of this monograph. We hope its usefulness will match the enthusiasm and expertise of its authors.

Rabbit meat quality
Best known for being prolific, rabbits are also herbivores which efficiently convert fodder to food. The whole point of meat production is to convert plant proteins of little or no to people as food into highvalue animal protein. In efficient production systems, rabbits can turn 20 percent of the proteins they eat into edible meat. Comparable figures for other species are 22-23 percent for broiler chickens, 16-18 percent for pigs and 8-12 percent for beef.
A similar calculation for the energy cost of these proteins is even more unfavourable to ruminants, as shown in Table 1. When cattle or sheep are raised for meat production, most of the energy consumed by the herd or flock is used to maintain breeding females which have a low prolificacy: a maximum of 0.8 to 1.4 young per year against 40 for female rabbits. Even with the theoretical lower energy cost when cattle are raised for both milk and beef (Table 1), rabbit meat is still more economical in terms of feed energy than beef. Rabbit meat production is therefore an attractive proposition, especially when the aim is to produce quality animal protein.
Rabbits can also easily convert the available proteins in cellulose-rich plants, whereas it is not economical to feed these to chickens and turkeys-the only animals with higher energetic and protein efficiency. The traditional grain and soycakes fed to these domestic poultry put them in direct competition with man for food. For countries with no cereal surpluses, rabbit meat production is thus especially interesting.
Historical background
The domestication of the major livestock species (cattle, sheep, pigs) and the small species (poultry) is lost in the dawn of prehistory. But rabbit domestication dates back no further than the present millenium.
Indeed the wild rabbit Oryctolagus cuniculus of southern Europe and North Africa is thought to have been discovered by Phoenicians when they reached the shores of Spain about 1000 BC. In Roman times the rabbit was still emblematic of Spain. The Romans apparently spread the rabbit throughout the Roman Empire as a game animal. Like the Spaniards of that time, they ate foetuses or newborn rabbits, which they called laurices.
Rabbits had still not been domesticated, but Varron (116-27 BC) suggested that rabbits be kept in leporaria, stone-walled pens or parks, with hares and other wild species for hunting. These leporaria were the origin of the warrens or game parks that subsequently developed in the Middle Ages. It is known that monks were in the habit of eating laurices during Lent as they were "an aquatic dish" (sic). In France, it became the sole right of the lord of the manor to keep warrens. Rabbits were hunted little, and were captured with snares, nooses or nets.
Several breeds of rabbit were known in the 16th century and this is the first record we have of controlled breeding. Domestication can therefore be traced to the date Middle Ages. This was probably the work mainly of monks, since it provided them with a more delectable dish than the tougher wild rabbit.
In the 16th century breeding seems to have spread across France, Italy, Flanders and England. In 1595, Agricola mentions the existence of graybrown (wild), white, black, piebald (black and white) and ash grey rabbits. In 1606, Olivier de Serres classified 3 types of rabbit: the wild rabbit, the semiwild or "warren" rabbit raised inside walls or ditches, and the domesticated or hutch-bred rabbit. The meat of the last is described as insipid, and that of the wild or semiwild type as delicate.

1Theoretical calculation for beef production of a dairy cattle breed, arbitrarily assigning total reproduction and maintenance costs of adult animals to milk production, retaining only feed portion consumed by slaughter animal, ie, 43.6 percent of total energy expenditure.
At the beginning of the 19th century, after the abolition of seigneurial privileges, rabbit rearing in hutches sprang up all over rural western Europe and also in city suburbs. During the same period, European colonial expansion saw the introduction of the rabbit in many countries where it was unknown, such as Australia and New Zealand.
In Europe, breeders usually had a few does and a stock of fattening animals, from which they took according to their needs, as from a larder.
The animals were fed mainly on green forage picked daily. In winter the breeders supplemented forage with hay, beetroots and even grains, often from the stocks intended for large livestock. Rabbits were kept in the backyard, with the poultry. Reproduction was extensive (2-3 litters a year).
From that time on there is frequent mention of the fur as a byproduct (the breed now called Champagne d'Argent was described as "rich"), and the already long-existing Angora mutant was recorded.
FROM TRADITIONAL TO RATIONAL PRODUCTION
Beginning in the late 19th century and picking up speed in the 20th, hutch rearing led to a rabbit population explosion made possible by the selection, protection and multiplication of breeds and mutants unadapted to the wild. Breeders formed associations. Breeding techniques were rationalized and hutch hygiene improved.
Breeding standards were laid down: each adult breeding animal was raised in a separate hutch because rabbits kept in a confined space became aggressive. Young rabbits for fattening were left together, but in this case the males were castrated. Feeding was the same as in the previous century, green fodder and grains, but the first feeding trials produced certain guidelines. The second world war saw the extensive development of rabbit production throughout Europe and Japan to cope with meat shortages. Under these demanding conditions, rabbits demonstrated their highly efficient feed conversion capacity.
In the 1950s, production slumped in Japan and the northern European countries as other meats with more flavour became available, such as frozen beef from the Southern Hemisphere. But in the Latin countries of Europe where people know how to cook rabbit, particularly in France, rabbits were Still produced. In the late 1950s, New Zealand rabbits, wiremesh cages and balanced pelleted feeds were all introduced into
France and Italy from the United States. At the same time, diseases hitherto unknown and apparently linked with the new production techniques (mucoid enteritis and respiratory ailments) appeared, and others disappeared (cenuriasis) or tapered off (coccidiosis).
These new techniques, originally better adapted to the climate of California than to that of northern Italy or France, demanded many modifications in production which were often discovered by trial and error. The hutches especially, which had always been kept outside, were put in closed buildings. Ventilation and lighting problems had to be solved.
The time spent on cleaning cages and collecting food shrank abruptly. This freed breeders to spend more time on the animals themselves. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, the work of authors such as Prud'hon et al. ( 1969) led to a sharp drop in weaning age, from eight weeks to four weeks. Post-kindling matings replaced post-weaning matings. Breeders were able to put into practice Hammond's early observations (1925) about postkindling fertilization of does because feeds were so much improved as to obviate the danger of abortion in lactating pregnant does through malnutrition.
At the same time came the explosion of the New Zealand White rabbit and its offshoot, the Californian. The traditional European breeds (Burgundy Fawn, Champagne d'Argent, French Lop, Flemish Giant, Termonde White, German and Spanish Giant, Giant Chinchilla) underwent a regression. As adults it is difficult for these breeds to live on the mesh floors of the cages-the pads of their paws not being adapted like those of the New Zealand White and Californian rabbits.
French and Italian breeders worked to improve substantially the first New Zealand White and Californian rabbits imported from the United States. In France, the 2 breeds were combined to produce specialized hybrid strains according to the design conceived by the French National Agricultural Research Institute (INRA). In the late 1970s, these strains crossed the French borders to Italy, Spain, Belgium and the Federal Republic of Germany, where in large commercial production units they tended to supplant the traditional breeds. Other hybrid strains were produced at the same time, especially in Hungary and the United Kingdom, but in almost every case new strains were bred from these original 2 breeds.
Traditional varicoloured rabbits were gradually replaced by white rabbits. This is having a considerable impact on the market for skins. Before the 1970s, furriers tended to favour the easy-to-dye white skins. Today the reverse is true-white skins are too common. At the same time, improved production techniques have lowered the slaughter age of rabbits in Europe which has reduced the value of the fur. The hair of the skins is "loose" because the animals are too young.

Productivity trends in France since the 1950s arc given in Table 2. Industrial rabbit production (specialists prefer the word "rational" to industrial, as the breeder's know-how is still very important) in Europe today is typically in units of 200-1 000 hybrid does reared in buildings with artificial or controlled ventilation. The breeding females are under artificial lighting for 15-16 hours a day and produce all through the year. All animals are reared in 1-4 storey mesh cages (flat-deck and batteries). Male and female breeding animals are raised in separate cages. Young animals for slaughter are raised in cages in groups of 5-10 (France, Spain) or 1-3 (Italy). Young males are not castrated because they are sold for slaughter before or just at puberty. All the animals are fed exclusively with balanced pelleted feed. Drinking water is automatically distributed to every cage.
At the same time there is a sizable increase in private (sophisticated buildings and breeding installations) and producer group investments (technical advisers). Typically, rational production consists of a very quick succession of all phases of the reproduction cycle. This demands extremely close and time-consuming supervision by the breeder. The technical adviser, not being directly involved in these day-to-day tasks, is of great assistance in the medium- and long-term running of a unit. His salary and ancillary costs amount to a sizable investment for a group of producers (1-3 percent of the sale price of a rabbit).
In many countries of eastern and western Europe (Poland, Hungary, France, Italy, Belgium, for example), a more traditional production system, very similar to that of the first 40 or 50 years of this century, still contributes a considerable part of the national output: over 90 percent in Hungary and nearly 40 percent in France. These traditional units are usually very small, with 2-12 breeding females.
World production
National statistics generally do not include rabbit production. But a few basic statistics from an FAO survey and various personal contacts suggest a possible world output of roughly 1 million tonnes of carcasses. This would mean an annual consumption of approximately 200 g of rabbit meat per person. But this is theoretical, as in many countries most people eat no rabbit meat whereas rural people in France eat nearly 10 kg a year.

Europe is indeed the centre of world rabbit production (Table 3). The foremost world producers, far surpassing all other countries, are the USSR (principally Russia and the Ukraine), France, Italy and Spain (Figure ] ). In all, Europe accounts for 85 percent of total world output. Production areas outside Europe are mainly in Central America, a few regions of Africa and in the Republic of Korea and China. Rabbits are not reared in most Arab countries. Table 4 estimates annual per caput rabbit production in producer countries.
EUROPEAN TRENDS, 1960-80
National production in the USSR is difficult to estimate as home consumption is not taken into account. But over the last 20 years there certainly seems to have been an increase in overall output: a probable rise of 20 000 tonnes to the present figure of 200 000-220 000 tonnes. In fact, sizable research efforts are made in the USSR to adapt western European methods and especially to develop systems and techniques suited to the country's potential.
The situation in France is somewhat different. Output stabilized at about 270 000 tonnes a year from 1965 to 1972, then slumped abruptly and now stands at roughly 180 000 tonnes. This situation is in line with the rapid drop in the number of very small producers who themselves used most of their production but who, because there were so many of them, supplied an appreciable share of the rabbits marketed. During this same period many newly established rational units of 50-500 does not only closed the small-scale producer gap, but also managed to increase slightly the tonnage of rabbits marketed, which rose from 110 000-120 000 tonnes in the years 1960-65 to 130 000-140 000 tonnes at present. A considerable research effort aimed at improving production techniques was responsible for this increase.
FIGURE 1. Estimate of annual production of rabbit carcasses in different countries, in thousand tonnes (INFRA-FAO Survey, 1981; Lebas, 1981)
The traditional production sector in Spain produced little during the 1960s. The many rational units set up from 1970 onwards made possible a spectacular leap in the output and marketing of rabbit meat. The present total is 120 000 tonnes. The production models were transposed directly from France.
Italy is between these two countries: it is unable to meet domestic demand and has to import sizable tonnages. But here again, newly established units are mostly large (500-1 000 breeder does).
Rabbit meat production and consumption in other western European countries are still low. However, there seems to be a slight increase in consumption in the Federal Republic of Germany, where breeders are being encouraged to increase their output. There is a large number of fancy breeders in the Federal Republic who raise a few pedigree animals as a hobby, and also eat a small proportion of the rabbits produced for this purpose. Production and consumption in Sweden and Norway are very low. Rabbit breeding is still a tradition in Denmark, though the national output, once exported mostly to the Federal Republic of Germany, has now dropped.
Among eastern European countries Hungary is the biggest producer. In this predominantly agricultural country family-scale rabbit production is encouraged. At the same time large production complexes with 10 000-15 000 breeding females have been set up. The young fattened animals from both systems are collected and the great majority exported to Italy. In the early 1970s, exports to Italy consisted mainly of live animals. The rabbits were slaughtered in the Milan area. Most rabbits from Hungary are now exported as fresh carcasses.
In Poland, small backyard rabbitries (5-20 breeding females) are still the rule. The rabbits produced are expected to provide good quality meat as well as fur for marketing. Therefore they are usually slaughtered late (4-6 months) for better skin quality. Some animals are collected as in Hungary, but exported as frozen carcasses (generally heavy). Recently rabbit production units of 5 000 breeding females have been established in Romania using French techniques and equipment.
NORTH AND SOUTH AMERICA
Rabbit production and consumption in the United States are concentrated mainly in the three Pacific States. Young rabbits of approximately 1.8 kg liveweight are eaten as "fryers". On the East Coast there is virtually no market and the only rabbits are pets. Rabbit production in Canada is modest, mainly concentrated in the Quebec province where it is subsidized by the provincial government. The slaughtered carcasses are a little heavier than in the United States.
In Mexico, the promotion of backyard rabbitries in rural areas has led to a total annual output of over 7 000 tonnes from these backyard units (producing mainly for home consumption) and commercial units combined. The latter are small (20-100 does) and use balanced concentrate feeds almost exclusively. The family units rely on forage (alfalfa, maize, or sorghum stems) and kitchen wastes.
In the Caribbean area, rabbit production is basically family style, using forage. The rabbits are often small local breeds, descended from animals imported some hundreds of years ago. However, notable efforts have been made in Cuba to develop improved breeds and use more intensive production methods. In Guadeloupe and Martinique, intensive commercial production in small units of 15-20 does has grown side by side with traditional production in the last decade. This development is based on animals and concentrate feeds imported from France. Output is good: does produce 30-40 young a year and these are sold at 2.2-2.4 kg, at about 80 days.
In South America the biggest producers are Brazil and Uruguay. In both countries the commercial units are large, with thousands of breeding females. The animals are raised intensively and fed locally manufactured balanced concentrate feeds.
ASIA
Rabbit production does not seem to have developed in Asia except in the Republic of Korea and, minimally, in Japan. The exception is China. No official statistics are published in China on the production and consumption of rabbit meat and it is difficult to approach the question of production in a country of a thousand million inhabitants without official statistics. However, it does appear that rabbits for export (mainly to Europe) are raised in a very special manner.
About 20 million Angora rabbits are farmed. They are usually slaughtered very young, after the second or third clipping at most. Production is therefore mixed, Angora wool plus meat. Thus, financially, meat appears to be the byproduct and Angora wool the main product, fetching 55-70 percent of the gross return for each animal. The animals are fed forage and a little grain and grain byproducts.
Production units do not appear to be spread throughout China, but rather concentrated in certain villages. This enables better support facilities to be provided and facilitates the organizing and marketing of a production which remains, in principle, at a traditional level.
AFRICA
The two main African producers are Ghana and Egypt both with 7 000-8 000 tonnes of carcasses a year. Far behind come Algeria and the Sudan, with 1 000-2 000 tonnes a year.
Although commercial production exists in these countries most rabbitries are family owned, with a part of the output going to the market. The national rabbit production development programme in Ghana, for example, proposes a system where small family units keep only 3-6 breeding animals, so they can be fed on what is growing locally-forage, cassava, etc.-and produce surplus animals for sale.

International trade
THE RABBIT MEAT MARKET
The tonnages of rabbit meat involved in international trade are not negligible in relation to national outputs, as shown in Tables 5 and 6. Almost every country in western Europe regularly imports several thousand tonnes of rabbit meat a year, and the trend is upwards.
The biggest producer, the USSR, neither imports nor exports rabbit meat. The two biggest import markets are Italy (16 000 tonnes) and France (14 000 tonnes), followed by the United Kingdom and the Federal Republic of Germany (5 000-8 000 tonnes) and finally the Benelux countries (4 000-5 000 tonnes). Denmark and Ireland import practically no rabbit meat. In Europe outside the EEC, Switzerland imports 2 000 tonnes and Austria barely 400 tonnes. Eastern European countries do not usually import rabbit meat.
From 1972 to 1980, imports in the EEC rose from about 24 000 to over 52 000 tonnes-more than double (+ 117 percent). The share covered by intra-EEC trading remains around 5 000-7 000 tonnes. France, the Netherlands and, very recently the United Kingdom are involved in this trade of which a small part consists of reexports.
In this period China (Table 6) has increased its sales of rabbit meat to EEC countries by 228 percent and eastern European countries, especially Hungary and Poland, have doubled theirs. In 1980, China covered 48 percent of EEC imports and eastern European countries 35 percent (Hungary 24 percent). Globally, net imports at present account for approximately 12 percent of total EEC rabbit meat consumption, estimated at 420 000 tonnes.

With the exception of the flow of rabbit meat from China to Europe, the trade outside Europe is very small. There are some Chinese exports to Japan and, in small quantities, to the United States and Canada. African countries import some 30-40 tonnes, often as fresh rabbit meat airfreighted from Europe (France' Italy). In 1980, Jordan imported a hundred tonnes.
Apart from China, the foremost exporter of rabbit meat, Uruguay is the only trader outside Europe of any significance. and it exports only about 40 tonnes.
THE MARKET FOR RABBIT SKINS
Data on skin marketing are scanty. France appears to be the main producer of raw skins, but the practice of reimportation after partial treatment rather complicates the figures. France uses 56 percent of the skins it produces, about 70 million. About 60 percent of these are poor quality skins from which only the hair is recovered ( 12-20 percent of dry pelt weight). The best quality skins are used after tanning for garments (5-8 percent) and linings, gloves, and so on.
Most other producers also market rabbit skins, but the USSR and Poland, for example, apparently make domestic use of all the skins they produce. Australia must be considered a producer, as it exports the skins of wild rabbits killed in extermination campaigns.
The main importers of raw skins are developing countries such as the Republic of Korea and the Philippines, which have low-priced manpower to do the dressing. After fairly complete processing, these skins are reexported to developed countries such as the United States, Japan, the Federal Republic of Germany and Italy.
ANGORA WOOL
Used mainly in textiles, the wool of the Angora rabbit forms a special sector of the international wool trade. World production is modest but the value per unit of weight is high: 40 to 50 times that of greasy wool.
Europe's share of the ever-growing world output, now estimated at 2 750 tonnes, is at present about 350-400 tonnes a year. Production is mainly concentrated in Czechoslovakia (80-120 tonnes a year), France (100 tonnes) and the Federal Republic of Germany (30-40 tonnes). A small amount is also produced in the United Kingdom, Spain, Switzerland, Poland and Belgium. For the rest of the world, Chinese production is highest, at 1 500-2 000 tonnes a year. Japan produces 50-60 tonnes a year. Small quantities are also produced in Argentina, the Republic of Korea and India.
There is brisk trading in both raw Angora wool and the spun yarn. The main end-users are Japan, the United States and the Federal Republic of Germany. The trade is characterized by regular 4-year cycles, due not to production, which is in fact regular, but to fluctuations in demand dictated by fashion.
Rabbit meat quality
CARCASS COMPOSITION
Carcasses are presented in different ways in different countries. Traditionally in Italy and certain African countries, rabbits for the market are simply bled and gutted. In France until recently the carcasses were sold skinned, with the thoracic viscera, liver and kidneys, and the head and paws still covered with fur. This changed in 1980, and now the paws must be removed.
In Canada and the United Kingdom the carcasses are dressed much as beef carcasses: no head, no viscera, and of course no paws. So slaughter yields can vary greatly from one country to another. Yields also vary among breeds (Table 7), and according to age (Table 8) and diet (Tables 9 and 10). Slaughter yield improves with age: for a given carcass weight, animals with a high growth rate, receiving more balanced feed, generally have a better carcass yield. Too much roughage in the diet tends to overdevelop the digestive tract and thereby lower yield.

MEAT COMPOSITION
Compared with the meat of other species, rabbit meat is richer in proteins and certain vitamins and minerals. However, it has less fat, as shown in Table 11. Rabbit fat contains less stearic and oleic acids than other species and higher proportions of the essential polyunsaturated linolenic and linoleic fatty acids (Table 12). The anatomical composition of the rabbit varies with age. The proportion of muscle mass to body weight remains constant: over 2 kg liveweight for a strain weighing 4 kg (adult animal). But the proportion of fatty tissue tends to increase. This ratio shows up in meat composition (Table 13).

The proportion of oleic acid in the fat also increases with age and palmitic acid decreases.
ORGANOLEPTIC PROPERTIES
The organoleptic properties of rabbit meat, like those of other species, are tenderness, juiciness and flavour.
Rabbit meat does not have a very strong flavour. It is comparable to, but not identical with chicken.
Tenderness varies with muscle age, and depends on changes in the proportion and type of conjunctive tissue supporting the muscle fibres. The younger rabbits are slaughtered, the more tender the meat will be. On the other hand, flavour tends to develop with age. Although little research has been done on this it is known that flavour improves with the quantity of internal fat in the muscle. In the same way, juiciness depends largely on the fat content of the carcass. The fatter the carcass the lower its water content, but the better it retains what juice it does have (Table 14).

Slaughter conditions, especially the onset of rigor mortis, can modify the tenderness and juiciness of rabbit carcasses.
Selection for growth rate combined with confined rearing favour the anaerobic metabolism of rabbit muscle tissue. Animals raised in rational rabbitries therefore have a higher proportion of white muscle fibre, which gives the meat a lighter colour.
CUSTOMER APPEAL
In Latin countries, which are traditional rabbit consumers, customer appeal is no problem. Rabbit meat is even classified as "sought after" and is eaten on special occasions. However, it is less frequently served when a guest is invited to join the family at table. In Anglo-Saxon countries, rabbit meat is not a traditional food. It is thought of as wartime fare, conjuring up memories of food shortages. A century ago, however, tens of thousands of rabbits were imported every week from the Netherlands for the London market.
In other countries the situation varies greatly. Whereas the Koran in no way prohibits rabbit meat, production and consumption are virtually nil in most Arab countries. Yet rabbits are a traditional food in certain Maghreb countries such as Egypt and the Sudan.

In Mexico, rabbit meat was almost unknown, but an advertising campaign boosted consumption. A reverse example is offered by Greece. A rational development programme of large-scale commercial production was implemented in mainland Greece in the late 1960s with relative success in technical terms. But marketing made no real headway as Greeks were not in the habit of eating this meat. There had been no advertising campaign to promote it so consumers did not buy it. Paradoxically, on the island of Crete, consumption is 4 kg per person per year.
The only religious bans concern Jews (consumption in Israel nil) and certain Hindu sects (general ban on eating meat). Formerly there was also a religious ban in force in Japan which forbade the eating of meat from four-legged animals. When rabbits were introduced into Japan in about 1350 by a Dutchman, the meat was sold as chicken. In modern Japan rabbit meat is eaten, though the total amount is still modest (750 tonnes from domestic production plus 3 000 tonnes imported from China).
In the 1981 INRA-FAO survey of 64 developing countries reporting on the development potential for rabbit production in their countries, 70 percent thought it possible and only 22 percent considered that social customs would not favour it. The remaining 8 percent were against it for religious or other reasons.
Rabbit meat consumption is much easier to develop where people are already used to eating widely different kinds of meat, as from hunting. This would be generally true of black Africa. Peoples with monotonous diets will find it harder to accept this new product. However' the example of Mexico, with its traditional diet of maize and kidney beans, shows that a well-planned development campaign can do much to promote necessary changes in eating habits.

Types of feed
Anatomy and physiology
In an adult (4-4.5 kg) or semi-adult (2.5-3 kg) rabbit the total length of the alimentary canal is 4.5 to 5 m. After a short oesophagus there is a simple stomach which stores about 60-80 g of a rather pasty mixture of feedstuffs.
The adjoining small intestine is about 3 m long and nearly I cm in diameter. The contents are liquid, especially in the upper part. Normally there are small tracts, about 12 cm long, which are empty. The small intestine ends at the base of the caecum. This second storage area is about 40-45 cm long with an average diameter of 3-4 cm. It contains 100-120 g of a uniform pasty mix with a dry matter content of about 20 percent.
Very near the end of the small intestine, at the entrance to the caecum, begins the exit to the colon. The caecum thus appears to be a blind pouch branching off from the small intestine-colon axis (Figure 2). Physiological studies show that this blind pouch-reservoir forms part of the digestive tract: the contents circulate from the base to the tip passing through the centre of the caecum, then return towards the base, along the wall. The caecum is followed by a 1.5 m colon: this is creased and dented for about 50 cm (proximal colon) and smooth in the terminal section (distal colon).
The alimentary canal, which develops rapidly in the young rabbit, is nearly full size in an animal of 2.5 kg, when it has reached only 60-70 percent of adult weight.
Two major glands secrete into the small intestine: the liver and the pancreas. Bile from the liver contains bile salts and many organic substances but no enzymes. Bile aids digestion catalytically. The reverse is true of pancreatic juice which contains a sizable quantity of digestive enzymes allowing the breakdown of proteins (trypsin, chymotrypsin), starch (amylase) and fats (lipase).
DIGESTIVE -TRACT AND CAECOTROPHY
Feed eaten by the rabbit quickly reaches the stomach. There it finds an acid environment. It remains in the stomach for a few hours (3-6), undergoing little chemical change. The contents of the stomach are gradually "injected" into the small intestine in short bursts, by strong stomach contractions. As the contents enter the small intestine they are diluted by the flow of bile, the first intestinal secretions and finally the pancreatic juice.
After enzymatic action from these last two secretions the elements that can easily be broken down are freed and pass through the intestinal wall to be carried by the blood to the cells. The particles that are not broken down after a total stay of about 11/2 hours in the small intestine enter the caecum. There they have to stay for a certain time, from 2 to12 hours, while they are attacked by bacterial enzymes. Elements which can be broken down by this new attack (mainly volatile fatty acids) are freed and in turn pass through the wall of the digestive tract and into the bloodstream.
FIGURE 2.-The digestive system of the rabbit
The content of the caecum is then evacuated into the colon. Approximately half consists of both large and small food particles not already broken down, while the other half consists of bacteria that have developed in the caecum, fed on matter from the small intestine.
So far, the functioning of the rabbit's digestive tract is virtually the same as that of other monogastric animals. Its uniqueness lies in the dual function of the proximal colon. If the caecum content enters the colon in the early part of the morning it undergoes few biochemical changes. The colon wall secretes a mucus which gradually envelops the pellets formed by the wall contractions. These pellets gather in elongated clusters and are called soft or night pellets (more scientifically, caecotrophes). If the caecal content enters the colon at another time of day the reaction of the proximal colon is entirely different.
Successive waves of contractions in alternating directions begin to act; the first to evacuate the content normally and the second to push it back into the caecum. Under the varying pressure and rhythm of these contractions the content is squeezed like a sponge. Most of the liquid part, containing soluble products and small particles of less than 0.1 mm, is forced back into the caecum. The solid part, containing mainly large particles over 0.3 mm long, forms hard pellets which are then expelled. In fact, due to this dual action, the colon produces two types of excrement: hard and soft. Table 15 shows the chemical composition of these pellets.
The hard pellets are expelled, but the soft pellets are recovered by the rabbit directly upon being expelled from the anus. To do this the rabbit twists itself round, sucks in the soft faeces as they emerge from the anus, then swallows without chewing them. The rabbit can retrieve the soft pellets easily, even from a mesh floor. By the end of the morning there are large numbers of these pellets inside the stomach, where they may comprise three quarters of the total content.
From then on the soft pellets follow the same digestive process as normal feed. Considering the fact that some parts of the intake may be recycled once, twice and even three or four times, and depending on the type of feed, the rabbit's digestive process lasts from 18 to 30 hours in all, averaging 20 hours.
Half the soft pellets consist of imperfectly broken-down food residues and what is left of the gastric secretions, and half of bacteria. The latter contain an appreciable amount of high-value proteins and watersoluble vitamins. The practice of caecotrophy therefore has a certain nutritional value.
The composition of the soft pellets and the quantity expelled daily are relatively independent of the type of feed ingested, since the bacteria remain constant. In particular, the amount of dry matter recycled daily through caecotrophy is independent of the fibre content of the feed (Table 16). The higher the crude content of the feed and/or the coarser the particles, the sooner it passes through the digestive tract.

On the other hand, this particular function requires roughage. If the feed contains few large particles and/or it is highly digestible, most of the caecal content is pushed back to the caecum and loses elements which nourish the ' normal" bacteria living in the caecum. This would appear to increase the risk of undesirable bacteria developing in this impoverished environment, some of which might be harmful.
It is thus advisable to include a minimum of roughage in the feed, enabling the rabbit's digestive process to be completed fairly rapidly. In theory, roughage is provided by the crude fibre content of the feed, as this is normally rather hard to digest. However, certain fibre sources (beetroot pulp, fruit pulp in general) are highly digestible (digestibility of crude fibre varies from 60 to 80 percent). For this reason recommendations are now made on quantities of indigestible crude fibre to be fed.
Table 17 gives the chemical composition of various raw materials which can be fed to rabbits.
Caecotrophy regulation depends on the integrity of the digestive flora, and is governed by intake rate. Experiments have shown that caecotrophy starts 8- 12 hours after the feeding of rationed animals, or after the intake peak of animals fed ad lib. In the latter case the intake rate and hence the function of Caecotrophy are governed by the light regime to which the animals are subjected.
Caecotrophy also depends on internal regulatory processes as yet not understood. In particular, the removal of the suprarenal glands halts caecotrophy. Cortisone injections of animals without suprarenal glands causes the resumption of normal behaviour. The digestive process of the rabbit appears to be highly dependent on adrenalin secretions. Hypersecretion associated with stress slows down digestive activity, and entails a high risk of digestive ailments.
Caecotrophy first starts to function in young rabbits (domesticated or wild) at the age of about 3 weeks, when they start eating solid feed in addition to mother's milk.
Feeding behaviour
Feeding behaviour studies have basically involved rabbits receiving balanced concentrates or fed ad /lb. on dry feed (cereals, straw, dry forage).
The feeding pattern of newborn rabbits is imposed by the dam. A doe in fact feeds her young only once every 24 hours (though some does will nurse their young twice). Suckling lasts only 2-3 minutes. If there is not enough milk the young try to feed every time the doe enters the nest box, but she will hold back her milk.
From the third week of life the young rabbits begin to move about, taking a few grams of mother's milk and a little drinking water if available. In a few days the intake of solid feed and water will exceed the milk intake. During this period the changes in feeding behaviour are remarkable: the young rabbit goes from a single milk feed a day to a large number of alternating solid and liquid feeds distributed irregularly throughout the day.

Table 18 gives an example of changing feeding behaviour in New Zealand White rabbits, aged from 6 to 18 weeks.
The number of solid meals, stable up to 12 weeks, tends to decrease slightly thereafter. The total time spent on feeding every 24 hours exceeds 3 hours at age 6 weeks. It then drops off rapidly, to less than 2 hours. At any age, feed containing over 70 percent water, such as green forage, will provide rabbits with ample water at temperatures under 20°C.
The consumption of solid and liquid intake fluctuates over a 24 hour period, as shown in Figure 3. Much more is consumed in the dark than in the light of both liquid and solid feed.
Intake in experimental hutches is very high just before the lights are switched off. As the rabbit grows older the nocturnal nature of its feeding habits becomes more pronounced. The number of feeds during light periods drops and the morning "feeding rest" tends to lengthen. The feeding habits of wild rabbits are even more nocturnal than those of domesticated rabbits.

The intake of feed and water depends on the kind of feed, and also on the type of rabbit and its age and stage of production. Taking as a reference animal an adult fed ad lib. ( 140-150 g of dry matter per day, for example, for a 4 kg New Zealand White): at 4 weeks a young rabbit eats a quarter of the amount an adult eats but its liveweight is only 14 percent of the adult's. At 8 weeks the relative proportions are 62 and 42 percent; at 16 weeks they are 100 to 110 and 87 percent.
A doe's ad lib. feeding during the reproduction cycle varies greatly (see Figure 4). The intake during the final days of pregnancy drops off markedly. Some does refuse solid food just before kindling. Water intake, however, never stops completely. After kindling, the feed intake increases very rapidly and can exceed 100 g dry matter/kg liveweight a day. Water intake is also high at that time: from 200 to 250 g a day per kg of liveweight. When a doe is both pregnant and lactating, she will eat the same amount as a doe that is lactating only, not more.

FIGURE 4.-Changing intake of balanced concentrate feed (89 percent DM) in a doe during gestation and lactation (Lebas, 1975)
FEEDING AND ENVIRONMENT
The rabbit's energy expenditure depends on ambient temperature. Feed intake to cope with energy needs is therefore linked to temperature.
Laboratory tests on growing rabbits showed that at temperatures between 5°C and 30°C intake of pelleted feed dropped from 180 to 120 g a day and water intake rose from 330 to 390 g (Table 19).

A closer analysis of feeding behaviour shows that as temperature rises the number of solid meals eaten in 24 hours drops. From 37 solid feeds at 10°C the number drops to only 27 at 30°C (young New Zealand White rabbits). The amount eaten at each meal drops with high temperatures (5.7 g from 10°C to 20°C down to 4.4 g at 30°C) but the water intake goes up, from 11.4 to 16.2 g between 10°C and 30°C.
If drinking water is not provided and the only feed available is dry with a moisture content of less than 14 percent, dry matter intake drops to nil within 24 hours. With no water at all, and depending on temperature and humidity, an adult rabbit can survive from 4 to 8 days without any irreversible damage, though its weight may drop 20-30 percent in less than a week.
Rabbits with access to drinking water but no solid feed can survive for 34 weeks. Within a few days they will drink 4-6 times as much water as normal. Sodium chloride in the water (0.45 percent) reduces this high intake, but potassium chloride has no effect (sodium loss through urination). The rabbit is therefore very resistant to hunger and relatively resistant to thirst; but any reduction in the water supply, in terms of water requirements, causes a proportional reduction in dry matter intake, with a consequent drop in performance.
FEEDING PREFERENCES
Given a choice of several feeds rabbits are often unpredictable. When dehydrated alfalfa and dry grain maize are offered the ratio chosen is 65 percent alfalfa to 35 percent maize. With alfalfa and oats the ratio is 60 to 40. But if the maize grains are rather moist, say with a 14-15 percent moisture content which could cause storage problems, the proportion of maize rises to 45-50 percent. When rabbits are offered rations containing dehydrated alfalfa with a variable saponin content, which gives the feeds varying degrees of bitterness, they choose the relatively bitter feeds. Such feeds are ignored by rats and pigs, as shown by Cheeke's tests in the United States.
Feeding rabbits forage plus supplementary concentrate feed raises problems when the forage is not very palatable. The experimental findings given in Table 20 demonstrate that in ad lib. feeding of both high-bulk and high-energy pelleted feeds rabbits are unable to adjust intake for maximum growth. A breeder faced by such a situation should limit the daily dose of concentrate feed or, generally speaking, the proportion of the more palatable feed. The problem sometimes arises with certain low-value green forages.
Growing rabbits receiving a pelleted feed lacking in sulfur amino acids or Iysine, and with access to pure water as well as these missing amino acids in solution, choose the amino acid solution over pure water. Thus they grow as well as control rabbits receiving balanced feed.

Nutritional needs
Various research experiments carried out in many countries, especially in France, in the last 15 years or so has resulted in reliable recommendations for the manufacture of rabbit feeds for optimum production (meat, milk) in temperate European conditions.
The experimental technique consists of manufacturing feeds in exact but varied mixes, feeding them to rabbits, and assessing production by weight gain or number and weight of young in a litter. The best feed mixes are thus established and nutrition experts have been able to draw up recommendations for four categories: resting adults (bucks, non producing does); pregnant but not lactating does; lactating does (pregnant or not); and young rabbits from weaning to slaughter agefrom 1 to about 21/2 months.
These standards have been established for the environmental conditions in Europe and are also based on the relative costs of nutrients in those countries. They are reference standards, and can be varied slightly to suit local costs. The upper and lower limits which should not be exceeded are listed at the end of this chapter.

Lactating does need the richest, most concentrated feed. They produce a milk three times richer than cow's milk, at the rate of 100300 g per day, and have few reserves compared to the demand made on them. The next category is growing rabbits (far more research work has been done on this than any other category). Young rabbits are followed by pregnant nonlactating does. Their feed can be slightly less rich than that of young growing rabbits. The last category is bucks, which do not need a rich diet.
Table 21 details the chemical composition of theoretically ideal feeds for each rabbit category. There are 4 broad classes of standards. First, standards on proteins and protein composition (distribution of amino acids). Proteins must supply the elements to build or rebuild rabbits bodies. The indigestible share of fibre serves to provide the slight congestion essential for the proper functioning of the digestive tract. Energy is needed to regulate body temperature as well as for the general functioning of the body. Minerals and vitamins are building blocks for certain parts of the animal (skeleton, etc.), and for the enzymes which use energy to build and rebuild the body proteins continually.
Table 21 also includes a column showing the chemical composition of a mixed feed suitable for all animals in a production unit. Its composition represents a compromise between the requirements of growing rabbits and those of lactating does. The other categories can, in fact, eat a richer feed without suffering any major drawbacks. Further on in the text it will be explained under what circumstances it is desirable to use mixed or more specialized feeds. But first, the various feed requirements are explored in greater depth.
* Nitrogen
The rabbit's response to the quality of the proteins in its diet has long been a controversial issue which has now been established beyond doubt. Researchers have found that growing rabbits need feed that contains certain amounts of 10 of the 21 amino acids that make up the proteins. These are called the basic or essential amino acids. With 2 additional amino acids which can partially replace 2 of the essential amino acids, here is the full list for rabbits: arginine, histidine, leucine, isoleucine, Iysine, phenylalanine plus tyrosine, methionine plus cystine, threonine, tryptophane and valine.
Studies on the quantities needed have been virtually confined to arginine, Iysine and the sulphur amino acids (methionine and cystine). Expressed as a percentage of the ration the minimum daily requirement is 0.6 percent of Iysine and sulphur amino acids and a least 0.8 percent arginine. The toxicity thresholds of Iysine and arginine are well above the recommended intake levels. For the sulphur amino acids, however, there is a slender margin between the amount the rabbit needs and an excess dose that would diminish its performance.
For the other essential amino acids the recommended amounts have been estimated simply on the basis of regular satisfactory diets. Where these essential amino acids are supplied by protein in the diet, 1516 percent crude proteins should be enough for fattening rabbits. Rabbits will always eat more of a balanced feed containing essential amino acids than the same feed without amino acids.
The optimum dose of crude protein for the breeding doe seems to be 1718 percent for proteins with the same amino acid balance as those needed by growing rabbits. The essential amino acid requirements of does are, in fact, still unknown. An increase of protein content to 21 percent leads to higher milk production but slightly reduces the number of young rabbits weaned in a given period.
At the present stage of knowledge the entire nitrogen intake must be made up of true proteins. So far every attempt to replace true proteins with nonprotein nitrogen such as urea and ammonium salts has failed.
* Energy and crude fibre
The energy needed for organic synthesizing is usually supplied by carbohydrates and to a lesser extent by fats. Where there is an excess of proteins these also help to supply energy after deamination.
The growing rabbit, like the breeding doe, adjusts its feed intake according to the energy concentration of the feeds offered to it where the proteins and other dietary components are balanced. For a growing New Zealand White or Californian rabbit the daily intake is around 220240 kcal of digestible energy (DE) per kg of metabolic weight (W^0.75). For the lactating doe the average amount is 300 kcal DE/kg W^0.75 and tops 360 kcal during maximum milk production (15th20th day of lactation). So it is hard to set a strict energy requirement, but it has been shown that intake is only correctly regulated between 2 200 and 3 200 kcal DE/kg of feed.
Because of this, concentrated energy feed must also contain all the other required nutrients in concentrated form so that a smaller volume of feed will supply the rabbit's needs.
The rabbit is known to have a specific need for the essential fatty acid, linoleic acid, but a conventional diet containing 34 percent fats generally supplies this. The only reason for including more fat in the diet would be to raise the energy concentration, as fats provide approximately twice as much energy as carbohydrates for the same weight. Depending on the kind of basic diet (basic energy level, protein content and quality) such an input of fats might or might not be nutritionally useful. In the present context more fat seems uneconomical.
In European feed rations, the poor digestibility of the fibrous parts of raw materials such as alfalfa and straw (digestibility 1030 percent) makes them secondary to starch, for example, in covering energy needs. However, the fibrous components from tender, usually young plants are much more digestible (3060 percent). They can then provide 1020 percent of energy requirements in favourable conditions.
The fibrous parts have another function: as roughage. Content is generally evaluated on the basis of crude fibre, though this analytical technique is far from perfect. To get enough roughage for growing rabbits a 1314 percent crude fibre content seems satisfactory. For lactating does a slightly lower content is acceptable (1011 percent). The more digestible the fibrous parts the higher the total input needed to supply at least 10 percent indigestible crude fibre.
* Minerals and vitamins
Studies on the calcium and phosphorus requirements of growing rabbits have shown they need much less than lactating does. Does transfer large amounts of minerals into their milk: 78 g a day in full lactation, of which about one quarter is calcium. Any sodium, potassium or chlorine imbalance in the diet can cause nephritis and birth accidents. The risk is particularly high when plants used in the feed have been fertilized with high rates of potassium. Some authors mention improved growth performance with excess intake of copper sulphate: 200 ppm copper. As with pigs, this must be an effect of the growth factor type.
Rabbits require watersoluble (B group and C) as well as fatsoluble vitamins (A, D, E, K). Microorganisms in the digestive flora synthesize sizable quantities of watersoluble vitamins which are utilized by the rabbit through caecotrophy. This intake is sufficient to cover maintenance requirements and for average production as far as the B group vitamins and vitamin C are concerned. However, fastgrowing animals respond favourably to the addition of 12 ppm of vitamins B1 and B6, 6 ppm of vitamin B2, and 3060 ppm of nicotinic acid (vitamin PP) in the diet. The addition of vitamin C will not influence growth, even at 1 per cent of diet. Less research has been done on fatsoluble vitamins, and the recommended intakes have been established empirically.
DEVIATING FROM STANDARD RECOMMENDATIONS
Feeds formulated in accordance with the standards given in Table 21 are satisfactory for intensive production. Rabbits can also be reared on feeds only approximating these standards, but the absolute performance level will be lower, though not necessarily uneconomical. Certain indicative values are given in Table 22. Reducing the protein intake of lactating does to 13 percent of the diet will not affect prolificacy but will reduce the weight of the young at weaning.
For crude fibre, when the intake of indigestible crude fibre is less than 10 percent of the feed ration lethal diarrhoea becomes a risk. Conversely, increasing it to above 12 percent does not wholly eliminate the risk of digestive ailments and, what is more, excessive roughage can reduce the energy value of the feed. Should energy value drop below 2 200 kcal DE/kg performance will suffer, but the animal's health will not be jeopardized.
With regard to minerals, if the feed ration is deficient in calcium and phosphorus lactating does will draw on their body reserves (mainly bone); but their total reserves are limited. Does deficient in calcium and phosphorus therefore cannot be exploited intensively.
Where there are multiple deficiencies it is hard to predict the reaction of the animals. It is best to experiment and measure impact of the feeds available. The standards listed in Table 21 provide a guide for complementary feed rations that will better serve the rabbit's needs.
MANUFACTURE AND STORAGE OF FEEDS
In Europe, rabbits are fed dry raw materials which complement one another to make a balanced feed. Once the best proportions have been established, the raw materials are weighed and put in a blender. They are usually first crushed into meal for a uniform feed mixture. If the mixture were intended for feeding chickens or pigs it could be given to the animals at this stage, but the rabbit has a very low tolerance for the dust inevitably present in meal. This problem is solved by compacting the mixture in a pelleting machine.
The ideal diameter for ordinary feeds is 34 mm, 5 mm being the maximum diameter to avoid waste (Table 23). The pellets should be no longer than 810 mm. The pelleting operation heats the product through friction, which improves nutritional value by some 57 percent compared with the meal mixture.

Using certain recipes rabbits can actually be fed feed in meal form (Table 24). What must be avoided at all costs is a very fine meal which would disturb the normal functioning of the rabbit's upper respiratory tract. Though it is a good filter for dust, it clogs quickly. Meal must not be given as feed where rabbits drink from a trough. The water will soon get dirty and the rabbits will immediately stop drinking and eating. A valvetype automatic watering system is recommended where meal is fed.
Feeding tests on mash (60 percent meal, 40 percent water) show it is feasible provided the troughs are kept scrupulously clean (Table 24).
In Europe, depending on the size of the production unit, feed is usually delivered in 40 to 50kg bags or in bulk. Bags are stored in a shed providing shelter from high temperatures and rain, and located near the rabbits but out of their reach. They are stored in piles away from damp ground or walls. The usual solution is a false wooden floor.
The room or shed is designed to hold a 2 months, supply. Deliveries should actually be made monthly, so feed can be used within 11/2 months of manufacture. At delivery, about 2 weeks' supply should be left over from the previous month.
For bulk delivery, feed is stored in silos that are filled from the top and emptied from the bottom. They should be completely emptied and disinfected for bacteria, fungi, etc. at least once a year.
Transport costs and, especially, a desirably fast turnover of feed stocks make mixed feed (see Table 21) appropriate for rabbitries with fewer than 200 breeding does. In units with more than 200 does it is preferable to use 2 feeds: one suitable for lactating and breeding does and one based on the standards for growing rabbits in all other categories. The use of 4 feed types is only feasible in production units with at least 1 000 does.
Types of feed
BALANCED PELLETED FEEDS
The traditional European diet for rabbits used to be cereals, bran and forage (green in summer and dried in winter). In winter, breeders also fed the animals fodder beets or carrots. This style of feeding is definitely on the way out, especially in the big producer countries like France, Italy and Spain.
In modern production systems, which account for most of the output, the animals are given balanced pelleted feeds conforming to the standards already described. A single feed type is generally used for all categories, corresponding to the mixed feed listed in Table 21. In intensive reproduction rabbitries, all rabbits except bucks are fed ad lib. Under less intensive regimes, does receive the same feed ration from the weaning of one litter to the birth of the next. The ration is normally 335 g DM per kg of liveweight per day.
Growing rabbits are always fed ad lib. when raised in a group. One watering point is sufficient for 1015 animals. The watering system must be checked regularly to ensure the animals do not suffer from lack of water due to a defective apparatus. One feeding rack is enough for 10 rabbits, but at least two are needed as a safety measure in case the pellet flow should get blocked. Each feeding place along the rack should be 78 cm long.
Breeders calculate the quantities of feed for total daily consumption for all animals as follows:
* young fattening rabbits (411 weeks): 110130 g;
* lactating does with litters (weaning at 4 weeks): 350380 g;
* adult (maintenance) rabbits: 120 g;
* for the rabbitry as a whole: from 1 to 1.4 kg of feed per mother cage per day.
Wellrun rabbitries, in France for example, calculate 4 kg of pelleted feed consumed for each kg of liveweight marketed. This calculation includes breeding rabbits. The best rabbitries use only 3.6 kg feed to produce 1 kg live rabbit. This represents a feed expenditure of 5.96.7 kg per kg of carcass. Keeping in mind the protein content of the feed and the carcasses, this means a yield of 190220 g of highgrade animal protein from 1 kg of plant protein, a return of 1922 percent.
FORAGE
Pilot trials in the Federal Republic of Germany have demonstrated that growing rabbits enclosed or penned in a natural meadow receiving no fertilizer can produce 240 kg of protein per hectare (1.2 tonnes of meat) annually in the form of carcasses. This gives some idea of the forage utilization potential of rabbits, though in the trials the rabbits exhibited a modest growth rate (2025 g a day compared with the 3040 g of cageor hutchraised rabbits) and a relatively high feed intake.
Climate and soils in most developing countries, however, are very different from those found in the Federal Republic of Germany. Direct rabbit grazing also poses problems of fencing and risks from predators to the point where this technique cannot be recommended. For this reason the authors have reviewed the various wild or cultivable plants used in both tropical and nontropical regions to feed rabbits reared in confinement. Cereals are intentionally left out as they are needed for human nutrition in most developing countries.
WILD AND CULTIVATED PLANTS SUITABLE FOR RABBIT FEED
The following information only concerns plants that have been positively tested in station and other trials for use as rabbit feed. They are listed under their Latin names in alphabetical order. The countries where they are used are indicated where possible.
A "high" nutrient value means the feed has a higher dry matter content than is required for rabbits. Unless otherwise indicated, nutrient content where shown is expressed as a percentage of dry matter. For detailed chemical compositions, readers should refer to the general documents in the bibliography, particularly Gohl's work on tropical forages published by FAO (1982). Digestibility of the nutrients has not usually been determined for the rabbit specifically. Lacking these data reference should be made to forage digestibility for ruminants, but absolute values cannot be transposed, especially for the fibrous fraction.
Amaranthus This forage has a 20 percent protein content. It has been tried out in Malawi to supplement a concentrate containing 39.5 percent grain maize, 26 percent maize bran, 34 percent groundnut oilcake and 0.5 percent table salt. Reproduction and growth were satisfactory: 20 rabbits per doe per year; growth of 15 g per day from 416 weeks. Amaranthus is routinely fed to rabbits at the Bunda Agricultural College in Lilongwe, Malawi. Modern hybrid varieties conventionally grown for human food can also be used for feeding rabbits.
Arachis hypogaea. Groundnut oilcake is a high protein feed (50 percent). It can be used for feed when not overpolluted by aflatoxins. The whole groundnut can also be fed, but this puts the rabbit into direct competition with people for food so this solution should only be considered under exceptional circumstances. Groundnut tops provide green forage and hay with a high protein content. This is the conventional use at the BoboDioulasso centre in Burkina Faso. The tops can also be used after the groundnuts have been harvested, but their protein content is less: it is about 15 percent before the groundnuts are removed and less than 10 percent after threshing.
The proteins in both the tops and the groundnut cake lack the sulphur amino acids.
Beta vulgaris. Fodder and fodder sugar beets supply much of the winter feed in traditional European rabbit production. Where they can be grown, beets can supply a good percentage of the energy demand. The fibrous fraction has a high digestibility (80 percent). Beet leaves are also good for rabbits. They contain 17 to 18 percent protein, but are very rich in minerals, especially potassium, which can cause digestive problems.
Brachiaria mutica. Fed to breeding does in the Philippines, pare grass has proved far more satisfactory than elephant grass (Pennisetum purpureum) or guinea grass (Panicum maximum). However, its low protein content (1013 percent) requires a nitrogen supplement (legumes, supplementary feed).
Brachiaria ruziziensis. In Burkina Faso this forage plant is part of the basic ration produced at the BoboDioulasso centre for its rabbitry. Like all grasses, however, it has a low protein content (813 percent). For proper utilization it should be supplemented by highprotein feeds. The forage could be grown together with Stylosanthes, for example, for a better balanced feed than either plant can provide alone.
Chamaecrista aeschynomene. This tropical legume is commonly used to feed Creole rabbits in Guadeloupe and Martinique.
Cocos nucifera. Young coconuts are fed to rabbits in the same area as a diet supplement and source of roughage. The coconut milk is drunk by humans, and the husks with the tender meat are given to the rabbits, which are very fond of coconuts.
Cucurbita foetidissima. Growing naturally in the semidesert area of northern Mexico, this member of the gourd family has an enormous root that is 65 percent starch. The crushed root is sundried in 23 days and as much as 30 percent can be added to balanced concentrate in place of grain sorghum for breeding and fattening rabbits. Trials at the University of Chihuahua in Mexico demonstrated no toxic effect.
The tops and especially the fruit are rich in protein (12 to 30 percent), but utilization trials have not yet been run on rabbits. Their very bitter taste, which is unattractive to other animals, is not necessarily an obstacle for rabbits. More tests on the possibilities of this interesting semidesert plant are needed.
Daucus carota. A traditional feed for European farm rabbits, carrots can be grown in many tropical countries. They are used in Zambia, in particular, to feed rabbits. Both leaves and roots have a comparable protein content of 1213 percent, but the leaveslike beet leaves are very rich in minerals.
Eichhornia crassipes. Rabbits will eat the leaves and bulbs of water hyacinth, but only 24 percent of the energy provided by the green plant is digestible. Incorporating 25 percent water hyacinth meal in a balanced feed gives good results. Amounts of 50 percent or more are less satisfactory. The arsenic content of the rabbit meat, especially the liver and kidneys, in water hyacinth trials raised grave doubts on the plant's potential for feeding rabbits where it grows in polluted water.
In rabbitries located near the Congo River in Zaire, breeders use a local water hyacinth of which the rabbits are very fond. In New Caledonia, a local hyacinth called water lily is also a traditional feed, again greatly liked by rabbits. The whole of the plantstem, bulb and roots is eaten.
Gynura cusimba. The leaves of this forage plant contain 27 percent protein. The plant is abundant in Nepal in the dry season. Rabbits like it but cattle, sheep and goats will not touch it. This difference in feed preference is a reminder that observations valid for one species do not necessarily apply to another.
Hibiscus rosasinensis. The branches of these shrubs, which are used as living fences in the Caribbean, can be fed to rabbits, as is now the practice in Haiti, for example. The young shoots contain some 15 percent protein and 16 percent crude fibre.
Indigofera arrecta. This legume grows wild in Mozambique, even during the dry season without irrigation. It is easy to grow from the seeds of the wild plant picked in season. Its high (25 percent) protein content makes it a valuable source of nitrogen for rabbits in Mozambique, especially during the dry season.
Ipomaea batatas. Sweet potatoes are a good source of energy (70 percent starch content) for human consumption and can easily be grown in a family garden. Surplus or specially grown crops could be used as an energy feed for rabbits. The tops when well developed are also a valuable feed because of their high protein content1620 percent. Sweet potato is used as a forage for rabbits in Mauritius, Guadeloupe and Martinique, mainly in backyard rabbitries.
Ipomaea tiliacea. This Convolvulacea grows wild in Guadeloupe and Martinique and is the traditional basic feed for creole rabbits. It is not planted but simply picked from the hedges where it grows wild.
Lespedeza spp. These legumes can provide a proteinrich green forage for rabbits, and could also be dried and fed as hay.
Leucaena leucocephala. This is probably the most studied legume in station rabbit trials. Its attraction is its high protein content (28 percent) and the fact that it can be grown during the dry season. Sowing and tillage are no problem in soils where this plant grows naturally (Mauritius, for example). In the absence of symbiotic bacteria, bacterial seeding can be used (Guadaloupe and Martinique).
The presence of the amino acid mimosine, which competes with tyrosine and phenylalanine, is to some authors a limiting factor for Leucaena leucocephala. They suggest that a prudent top ration of this acacia for rabbits would be 25 percent (Mozambique). But growth trials on the island of Mauritius show that Leucaena can replace 40 and even 60 percent of balanced feeds without adversely affecting animal growth or health (Figure 5). In these trials, even where the acacia was used alone, the authors noted no incidence of diarrhoea or symptoms attributable to mimosine.
Other trials in Malawi used Leucaena as a supplementary fodder for a concentrate feed (described in the paragraph on Amaranthus) with good results for both growth and reproduction. Also tested in Malawi as a maize bran supplement, Leucaena proved satisfactory for growth (60 g a week) and better than Tridax procumbens and, especially, Pen nisetum purpureum. Used as a supplementary feed for broiler chickens, growth rates of 100110 g a week were recorded.
FIGURE 5.Weight gain trends in New Zealand White rabbits aged from 6 to 14 weeks in relation to intake of balanced feed (Ramschurn, 1978)
Despite these encouraging results the problem of mimosine remains. Mimosine toxicity is cumulative and perhaps did not show up in the growth trials, though these covered the entire fattening period. Several continuous trials in Mauritius, Togo and Malawi, using Leucaena at levels of 10 and 20 percent, have not had any ill effects on growth or reproduction. As mimosine is an amino acid, drying the forage does not reduce its toxicity to animals, though no special rabbit trials have been run on this aspect.
Manihot utilissima. Ghana's rabbit development programme includes growing cassava for feed. The inclusion of from 15 to 45 percent cassava meal (87 percent starch and 2.5 to 3 percent protein) in balanced feeds, supplemented by 200 g green forage daily, has given growth and reproduction results comparable to those obtained with the balanced control feed without cassava. But cassava should not be used to feed rabbits except where the human population already has plenty of energy foods. Moreover, cassava meal requires a protein and crude fibre supplement.
However ,cassava peels contain 6 percent protein and 10 percent crude fibre, and the leaves contain 2428 percent protein, so the potential of these two cassava products for rabbit feed should be tested in comparative trials.
Marremia tuberosa. This proteinrich (24 percent) forage is used in Mozambique to feed rabbits. It grows during the dry season.
Medicago saliva. Alfalfa is unquestionably the standard rabbit forage, wherever it can be grown. It is grown under irrigation in Mexico and Mozambique. It does not grow in hot tropical areas such as the Caribbean. Breeding and growing rabbits can be fed solely on green alfalfa. The hay is harder for them to ingest. Alfalfa's rather high saponin content makes it especially palatable to rabbits.
Mimosa pigra. No negative effects were noted in tests run on this thorny plant in Thailand. It was used to replace Brachiaria mutica in rabbit feed. Its 22 percent protein content is comparable to that of Leucaena leucocephala.
Musa spp. Rabbits can be fed on banana rejects. Bananas are rich in energy and poor in protein (56 percent) and must be supplemented. Rabbit breeders use banana rejects in various African countries and in Guadeloupe and Martinique. The leaves can also be used as green forage (Zambia, Guadeloupe and Martinique). Their protein content is 1011 percent of the dry matter. Data are available on the leaves as rabbit feed, but not on the stems. They contain only 1.52 percent protein and with a 70 percent nitrogenfree extract could make a useful energy feed.
Opuntia ficus. The aerial part of prickly pear cactus can be fed to rabbits. At levels higher than 40 percent of the feed ration, however, the risk of diarrhoea arises because the fibrous portion is highly digestible.
Panicum maximum. In various comparison trials with other forages guinea grass made a poor showing mainly because of its low protein content510 percent of the dry matter according to how ripe the grass is. Despite this, guinea grass is part of the basic feed ration for rabbits in Ghana, Guadeloupe and Martinique. Its function is mainly to provide crude fibre and a small amount of energy. There is another use for guinea grass: dried' the plant is sometimes used as straw litter for the nest box, when breeding does are raised on a mesh floor.
Pennisetum purpureum. Feed trials with breeding and growing rabbits using elephant grass gave even poorer results than guinea grass, again because of low protein content (68 percent). A Malawi trial using elephant grass as a supplement for maize bran produced growth rates of only 15 g a week compared to 60 g with Leucaena leucocephala; but it can be used as a source of crude fibre for rabbits, as is done in Guadeloupe and Martinique. A mixed crop where elephant grass supports a climbing legume such as Pueraria is planned in Zaire. The combination gives a much better balanced forage.
The dried stems of Pennisetum can be used as straw litter or bedding in the nest box.
Psilotricum boivinianum. This forage grows without irrigation in the dry season in Mozambique and has a high protein content (2021 percent), making it an attractive forage feed for rabbits.
Pueraria spp. The legumes of this genus, such as P. phaseoloides and P. javanica, are recommended as rabbit feed in different countries of Africa, especially in Ghana. P. javanica is the basic feed of many farm rabbitries in Zaire. Rabbits are very fond of it. Like Stylosanthes, Pueraria remain green even in the dry season.
Saccharum officinarum. Sugarcane can be grown in countries with wet tropical climates and is a good rabbit feed, despite its low protein content (12 percent). In an early trial in Mauritius, roughly chopped sugarcane was successfully used to replace one half the balanced concentrate feed ration with no consequent drop in performance. In a complementary trial, the same authors found that, fed ad lib., rabbits chose to replace up to 40 percent of their balanced concentrate feed with chopped sugarcane. In a similar ad lib. feeding test, Leucaena leucocephala replaced up to 60 percent of the same balanced concentrate feed. In a New Caledonia trial it was shown that rabbits prefer to eat first the dry leaves, then the green leaves and then the cane itself, chopped small.
Setaria spp. These species of forage are used in Mauritius to supplement concentrated feeds for rabbits. Like all grasses, Setaria are poor in proteins.
Solanum tuberosum. Cooked potatoes can very well be used to feed rabbits, but this puts the animals into competition with people for food. Potato peelings are part of the kitchen waste in many countries and can be used in feed. However, apart from the fact that the peelings should be fed cooked not raw great care must be taken not to use the parings of potatoes which have turned green with exposure to light. Laboratory animals stopped growing when they were given 20 g of green potato peelings a day in addition to their normal feed ration.
Sorghum vulgare. Sorghum tops as well as grain are a good rabbit feed. They are used in Ghana and Mexico.
Stylosanthes spp. Legumes of this genus can be grown in all wet and dry tropical climates. In dry areas they virtually stop growing during the dry season, but remain green. Different species have been used for rabbits, including S. gracilis (Ghana, Zaire, Burkina Faso) and S. hamata (Martinique).
Taraxacum officinale. The dandelion is among the wild plants conventionally fed to rabbits in traditional European rabbit production. The use of this composite plant as rabbit feed has also been reported in Togo.
Tridax procumbens. Considered a weed on the Malawi grasslands, the advantage of Tridax is that it grows during the dry season. Its 1213 percent protein content also makes it a good rabbit feed. The plant proved satisfactory as a concentrate feed supplement in Malawi. Growth performance trials with Tridax as a maize bran supplement, however, were poorer than trials with Leucaena leucocephala, though more promising than results from Pennisetum purpureum, probably because of the differing protein content of the three plants.
Trifolium alexandrinum. This Egyptian clover (berseem), typical of the Mediterranean climate, is virtually the only rabbit feed used in the Sudan. Feeding trials in Egypt using the clover alone produced live weights of 1.23 kg at 16 weeks for crossbred Baladi x Flanders Giant rabbits, with an average weekly gain of 67 g. Like all legumes this clover variety has a high protein content.
Vicia spp. Wild vetches, grown alone or interplanted with grasses, can supply a proteinrich forage attractive to rabbits. The plant grows so quickly, however' that the tendency is to use it as hay, unless planting can be staggered for a continuing crop.
Vigna sinensis. These wild peas of Guadeloupe and Martinique supply nitrogenrich green forage and grain. Both V. sinensis and V. unguiculata are used as rabbit feed in these islands.
Zea mays. Although maize grain is needed as food for people in most developing countries, its use as fodder would be feasible in certain regions. The protein content of maize forage is low, so it requires a nitrogen supplement. Maize is used as forage in Burkina Faso, for instance.
This rather lengthy list of plants that have been tested as rabbit feed does not include every usable plant. There are such grasses as the various species of Digitaria, for example, though these are usually poor in protein. Where cabbage can be grown it should be added to the list. Cabbage is a traditional rabbit feed in France. Its 1720 percent protein content is fairly high.
Leaves of trees such as the mulberry could be a potential feed for rabbits. Trials have shown that rabbits will eat mulberry leaves but their nutritive value has not yet been determined. Ash leaves used to be a common feed on farms in France and are still used as feed in Algeria. They contain about 17 percent protein.
AGRICULTURAL AND INDUSTRIAL BYPRODUCTS
The various agricultural and industrial byproducts will not be reviewed here, as lists of byproducts and their composition are usually available for each region. Only a few need special mention. First of all the various tropical oilcakes, such as groundnut, already described, palm nut and coconut. Cottonseed cake should be used very prudently, as rabbits are at least as sensitive as pigs to gossypol.
Brewer's dregs and citrus pulp are possible feed sources, where the processing plants are not too far from the rabbitry. Rabbits can also be fed waste products from pineapple canneries, as in Ivory Coast, but pineapples are poor in protein.
Brewer's draff from the manufacture of barleybased beer and dolo dregs from millet beer can produce good results. In a test conducted in Burkina Faso, dolo dregs were used as 80 percent of a concentrate feed with 10 percent groundnut cake, 6 percent blood meal and 4 percent bone meal. This was fed with a forage supplement of green Brachiaria or dried groundnut tops. Local rabbits grew faster with this feed ( 104 g a week) than with an imported balanced concentrate feed (83 g).

Anatomy of the genitals
In the male, the oval-shaped testes within the scrotum remain in communication with the abdominal cavity, where they were at birth. The rabbit is actually able to withdraw its testes when frightened or fighting with other males. The testicles descend at about 2 months. The short, backslanting penis points forward when erect. Figure 6 shows the relative position of the various organs.
FIGURE 6.-Genital apparatus of male rabbit
In the female, ovaries are oval-shaped and do not exceed 1-1.5 cm. Beneath the ovaries is the oviduct, made up of the duct, the ampulla and the isthmus. Though outwardly the uterine horns are joined at the back into a single organ, there are actually two independent uteri of about 7 cm, opening separately through two cervical ducts into the 6-10 cm vagina. The urethra opens midway along the vagina at the vaginal vestibule. The glands of Bartholin and the preputial glands can be identified. The whole is supported by the broad ligament attached at 4 main points under the vertebral column.
Figure 7 shows the relative position of the various organs.
FIGURE 7.-Genital apparatus of female rabbit
Male reproduction physiology
· Gonad development and puberty
The gonads begin to differentiate on the 16th day after fertilization. After birth the testes develop less quickly than the rest of the body. From the age of 5 weeks they begin to grow very rapidly. Accessory glands undergo a similar development, but at a more even rate and are less precocious.
Spermatogenesis begins between days 40 and 50. The testicular tubes become active at about 84 days. The first spermatozoa are present in the ejaculate at about 110 days.
Sexual maturity, defined as the moment when daily sperm production ceases to increase, is reached at 32 weeks by New Zealand White rabbits in temperate climates. However, a young buck in these same conditions can be used for reproduction from the age of 20 weeks. Indeed the first manifestations of sexual behaviour appear at days 60-70 when the rabbit makes its first attempts at riding. Coitus may occur for the first time at about 100 days, but the viability of the sperm cells is very weak or nil in the first ejaculates. So first mating should be timed for age 135-140 days.
All these figures are to be considered approximate. The onset of puberty varies from breed to breed, but conditions in the rabbitry also play an essential role, particularly feeding, which is even more important than climate.
* Sperm production
The volume of semen ejaculated is about 0.3-0.6 ml. Concentration is evaluated at 150-500 x 106 spermatozoa per ml, but both volume and concentration are liable to vary. False mountings, 1 or 2 minutes before copulation, increase the concentration of the ejaculate. In 2 successive servicings the first acts as a preparation for the second, which is less voluminous but more concentrated. During subsequent matings the volume of the ejaculate decreases, while concentration increases between the first and the second ejaculate and then diminishes. The total number of spermatozoa per ejaculate follows the same trend.
Maximum spermatozoa production is obtained by using the buck regularly once a day. If the buck is used regularly twice a day, each ejaculate has only one half the concentration of spermatozoa. On the other hand, if bucks service several times a day, 1 day a week, the 3 or 4 ejaculates may be concentrated enough to effect fertilization. Further ejaculates contain very little spermatozoa and cannot effect fertilization often enough to be worthwhile.
Female reproduction physiology
* Gonad development, puberty and sexual maturity
As in the male foetus, sexual differentiation takes place on the 16th day after fertilization. Ovogonial division begins on the 21st day of foetal life and continues until birth.
The first follicles appear on the 13th day after birth, and the first antrum follicles at about 65-70 days. Does are able to mate first at 10-12 weeks, but as a rule this will not produce ovulation. The onset of puberty varies greatly with:
* the breed: sexual precocity is more developed in small or medium breeds (4-6 months) than in large breeds (5-8 months). In Europe does are now mated at 120-130 days and fertility performance is good;
* body development: precocity goes hand in hand with rapid growth. Does fed ad lib. reach puberty 3 weeks earlier than other does of the same strain receiving only 75 percent of the same daily feed. The body development of the latter is also retarded by 3 weeks.
Does generally reach puberty when they have grown to 70-75 percent of their mature weight. However, it is usually preferable to wait until they reach 80 percent of their mature weight before breeding them. These relative weights should not be considered absolute thresholds for all rabbits, but rather limits applicable to the population as a whole. Sexual behaviour (acceptance of mating) appears long before the ability to ovulate and bear a litter. Such behaviour should not be regarded by the breeder as a sign of puberty, but as prepuberty play.
* The "oestrus cycle"
In most domestic mammals ovulation takes place at regular intervals when the female is in heat or oestrus. The interval between two periods of oestrus represents the length of the oestrus cycle (4 days for rats, 17 for ewes, 21 for sows and cows).
The female rabbit, however, does not have an oestrus cycle with regular periods of heat during which ovulation will occur spontaneously. Does are considered to be in oestrus more or less permanently. Ovulation occurs only after mating. A female rabbit is therefore considered to be in heat when she accepts service and in dioestrus when she refuses.
FIGURE 8.-Sexual behaviour and duration of oestrus in 5 pubescent nulliparous does (Moret, 1980)
There are many observations which denote the alternating periods of oestrus during which the doe accepts mating, and dioestrus in which she refuses (Figure 8). But the present state of knowledge does not make it possible to predict either the respective lengths of oestrus and dioestrus or the environmental or hormonal factors determining them.
It has been noted, however, that 90 percent of the time when a doe has a red vulva she will accept mating and ovulate, whereas when the vulva is not red the doe will accept service and become fertilized only 10 percent of the time. A red vulva is therefore a strong indication, though not a proof, of oestrus. A doe in heat assumes a characteristic pose, called lordosis, with the back arched downwards and hindquarters raised. A doe in dioestrus tends to crouch in a corner of the cage or exhibit aggression towards the buck.
The sexual behaviour of a female rabbit is thus very special. She has no cycle and can stay in heat for several days running. On the ovary, follicles not having evolved to the ovulation stage through lack of stimulation undergo regression and are replaced by new follicles, which remain for a few days in the pre-ovulating state and may then in turn regress.
In most mammals the progesterone secreted during gestation inhibits oestrus and the pregnant female refuses to mate, but a pregnant doe may accept mating throughout the gestation period. Indeed, in the second half of pregnancy this is the most common behaviour (Figure 9).
A breeder cannot therefore use the sexual behaviour of does as an indication of pregnancy. Mating occurring during gestation has no dire consequences for the embryos. Unlike the phenomenon observed in the female hare, superfoetation (2 simultaneous pregnancies at 2 different stages of development) never occurs in rabbits.
FIGURE 9.-Mating acceptance trends in gestating does (Moret, 1980)
* Ovulation
Ovulation is normally induced by the stimuli associated with coitus and occurs 10-12 hours after mating, as outlined in Figure 10.
Given this sort of pattern, ovulation can be induced artificially by various techniques. Mechanical stimulation of the vagina can cause ovulation, but the outcome is quite random. Injections of LHRH or LH can produce results, though repeated injections of the LH hormone lead to immunization and loss of effect beyond the 5th or 6th injection. Injections of LHRH repeated at 35 days for 2 years, however, have involved no loss of effect: 65 to 80 percent of the does became pregnant from this injection followed by artificial insemination.
FIGURE 10.-Onset of ovulation following coitus
* Fertilization and gestation
At the moment the ovary follicles are ruptured the oviduct pavilion or infundibulum covers the ovary. When liberated the ovocytes are sucked in by the pavilion. The ovocytes are in fact fertilizable from the moment they are liberated, but they are not actually fertilized until about an hour and a half after release. The sperm is deposited by the male in the upper part of the vagina. The spermatozoa make their way upwards rapidly. They can reach the fertilization area (in the distal ampulla, near the isthmus) 30 minutes after coitus. During their journey the spermatozoa undergo a maturing process which enables them to fertilize the ovocytes. Of the 150200 million spermatozoa ejaculated, only 2 million (1 percent) will reach the uterus. The rest are defeated by obstacles at the cervix and uterotubal junction.
The egg reaches the uterus 72 hours after ovulation. On its way through the oviduct the egg divides. The uterine wall differentiates, but the uterine dentellus appears only 5-8 days after coitus. It is the synchronization of these phenomena that makes possible the implantation of the egg. Implantation proper takes place 7 days after mating, at the blastocyst stage. Distribution of the blastocysts is roughly equidistant in each horn, but the blastocysts never move from one uterine horn to the other. From the 3rd to the 15th day after mating the progesterone rate continues to increase, then remains stationary and finally drops rapidly before parturition.
The maternal placenta develops along with the foetus, reaching its maximum weight towards the 16th day of pregnancy. The foetal placenta is visible about the 10th day, and becomes larger until birth (Figure 1 1).
Embryo losses, measured by comparing the numbers of corpus luteum and living embryos, are usually very extensive. Generally speaking only 60-70 percent of the eggs become live rabbits. Most embryo mortalities occur in the 15 days before birth. Mortality is partly due to the viability of the embryos and partly to their situation in the uterine horns. External factors also play a part: the season, and the physiological condition of the doe (especially her age).
* Pseudopregnancy
Liberated ova which are not fertilized may occasion a pseudopregnancy lasting 15-17 days. At first the corpus luteum and uterus develop as in an ordinary pregnancy, but they do not reach the size or the level of progesterone production of the corpus luteum in pregnancy. Towards the 12th day they regress and disappear under the action of a luteolytic factor secreted by the uterus, undoubtedly prostaglandin. The end of pseudopregnancy is marked by the maternal behaviour of the doe and nestmaking. While such pseudopregnancy is much used in research laboratories on the physiology of reproduction, it is very uncommon in rabbits. Indeed, when a doe is serviced under unfavourable conditions she does not ovulate, and it is exceptional for ovulation to occur without fertilization (as in mating with a sterile but sexually active buck).
FIGURE 11.-Changing weights of foetus and embryonic membranes during gestation (Hammond and Marshall, 1925)
* Kindling
The mechanism of parturition is not very well known. It seems that the secretion of corticosteroids by the suprarenals of the young plays a part, as in other animal species, in giving the signal for parturition. At the end of gestation the doe makes a nest for the litter with her own fur and materials she has available such as straw and shavings. This behaviour is linked with an increase in the oestrogen/progesterone ratio and with the secretion of prolactin. The doe does not always make a nest, or she may kindle outside the nesting box.
Kindling lasts from 15 to 30 minutes, according to the size of the litter. Litter size varies as much as from 1 to 20 young. Most litters range between 3 and 12. In rabbit production units the average is 7-9, but there are great variations.
After parturition the uterus retracts very quickly, losing more than half its weight in less than 48 hours.
* Lactation
Milk synthesis depends on prolactin, a lactogenic hormone. During pregnancy prolactin is inhibited by the oestrogens and by progesterone. At parturition there is a rapid drop in the progesterone level. As oxytocin is freed the action of the prolactin is stimulated and permits the milk to mount in a predeveloped gland.
Milk is let down as follows: the doe comes into the nest box to nurse her litter. The stimulus of nursing provokes the secretion of oxytocin. inframammary pressure mounts, the milk is let down and the young suckle. The amount of oxytocin secreted is proportional to the number of young feeding. But the doe sets the number of feeds: just once in 24 hours. Suckling alone will not provoke the secretion of oxytocin; the mother must want to nurse.
* Aspects of milk production
Doe's milk is much more concentrated than cow's milk except for the lactose component (see Table 25). After the 3rd week of lactation the milk becomes markedly richer in proteins and especially fats (up to 2022 percent). The already low lactose content tapers off to almost zero after the 30th day of lactation.
Daily milk production increases from 30-50 g in the first 2 days to 200250 g towards the end of the 3rd week of lactation. It then drops rapidly. The decrease is even swifter if the doe has been fertilized immediately after kindling (Figure 12). The lactation curve varies from doe to doe, especially with regard to duration.

Measuring the young rabbits' weight at 21 days gives a fairly good estimate of total lactation, as milk production between days 0 and 21 is closely correlated with total milk production (r + = 0.92). The doe's milk output increases with litter size but the baby rabbits get less milk each than they would in a smaller litter.
FIGURE 12.-Pattern of milk production in lactating and gestating, lactating does (Lebas,1972)
Reproduction and environment
* Lighting
Males exposed to artificial lighting for only 8 out of the 24 hours produce significantly more sperm than those exposed to light for 16 hours.
Does, however, are far more opposed to mating with only 8 hours of light than they are with 16. For both males and females 12 hours of light a day produce average results. The practice in rational European rabbit production units is to light breeding areas artificially for 15-16 hours a day. The and females are together in the same room. The advantage of the does' behaviour and fertilization more than compensates for the drawback of the males' reaction to the light.
FIGURE 13.-Changing liveweights of young does aged from 37 to 112 days reared in different temperatures (Matheron and Martial, 1981 )
* Temperature
The impact of temperature on spermatogenesis has been studied by various authors, but usually for short periods ranging from just a few hours to a few weeks at most. In a prolonged 5-week trial, Oloufa et al. (1951) noted actual falls in the volume and concentration of ejaculates at a high temperature (33°C). A high temperature also affects sperm motility even after such short periods of exposure as 8 hours at 36°C, or medium periods such as 14 days at 30°C. Furthermore, and this seems to be the worst effect, temperatures in excess of 30°C reduce the bucks' sexual urge.
However, these findings should not obscure the fact that rabbits do reproduce effectively in hot tropical or equatorial climates. Breeders should take the precaution of protecting their rabbits against extreme heat; they should avoid direct sunshine and protect the cages with an insulating roof, not just a corrugated metal sheet (which in fact transmits too much heat).
It should be noted that humidity does not seem to have been recorded in the various laboratory tests on the effects of temperature on spermatogenesis.
High temperatures also seem to affect female rabbits negatively. The lower prolificacy attributed to does reared in hot climates (30-31°) would appear to be due not so much to the temperature itself as to a reduction in body weight caused by a lower feed intake in the heat (Figure 13). It would seem, however, that embryo mortality increases when the temperature exceeds 30-33°C, though here again decreased feed intake needs to be considered as a possible cause.
* Season
In Europe the season is usually analysed in terms of the combined effects of light and temperature. In tropical climates the temperature effect seems to be dominant, but an effect due to variations in the length of daylight cannot be excluded. The reproduction cycles of the European wild rabbit are strongly influenced by the season. Does breed from the end of winter until early summer (Figure 14). The reproduction period can he longer or shorter, at either end, according to both temperature and availability of feed.
FIGURE 14.-Seasonal variation in percentage of gestating and/or lactating wild does in the United Kingdom (Stephen, 1952)
Exposing domestic does to light for 16 out of 24 hours in Europe considerably attenuates this seasonal variation; indeed it nearly suppresses it. Even so, reproduction problems sometimes appear at the end of summer with no direct relation to the temperature. In tropical climates a drop in the rate of reproduction is noted during the same period, the wet season, when temperatures are high and so is humidity.
Rates of reproduction
The physiological features of the male and especially the female are such that the breeder has great latitude in choosing a reproduction method. But for successful rabbit production the choice of method must be preceded by careful study and planning. The goal is to increase doe productivity and reduce inputs.
Productivity, defined as the number of young per doe per unit of time, depends on: the interval between successive kindlings; litter size at birth; and the survival rate of the young.
These criteria can be improved by slow, methodical selection and careful management of the rabbitry environment. In practice the crucial factor in increasing productivity is shortening the kindling-tomating interval. This means nonproductive periods must be pared as far as possible. Before such a strategy is adopted the breeder should consider:
* whether or not it will be exhausting for the does, perhaps leading to premature culling (this depends mainly on feeding conditions);
* whether or not it might cause a spontaneous reduction in doe fertility and prolificacy;
* whether it will lead to more work for the breeder. The breeder's desire to improve working conditions and reduce labour costs must also be considered.
AGE AT FIRST MATING
Before discussing the rate of reproduction, the first factor to consider is the age at first mating. If the unproductive period before the first litter can be shortened rabbit productivity will naturally be increased. Studies conducted in France on does receiving a balanced concentrated feed showed that female rabbits first serviced at 51/2 months had a lower annual productivity than females serviced 3 weeks earlier. The first group had virtually reached their adult weight and were too fat. The best plan is to have does serviced as soon as they reach 80, or at the most, 85 percent of the mature weight for their breed. Females can be serviced even earlier if their feed is extremely well balanced.
The three basic reproduction rates
The second method of stepping up production, after earlier servicing, is to accelerate the rate of reproduction. This amounts to shortening the theoretical interval between 2 successive litters. In fact, the true rate of reproduction is always slower than the theoretical rate because not all does immediately accept the buck and not all are fertilized when retired. There are 3 basic rates of reproduction: extensive, semi-intensive and intensive.
* Extensive reproduction rate
The breeder fully utilizes the does' maternal instincts by allowing them to nurse their young for 5-6 weeks, rebreeding them soon after weaning. Does are therefore serviced once every 21/2 months.
Later weaning is in no way advantageous except for fryer production -very young animals which can be sold at 8 weeks and have not undergone weaning shock. In the United States and the United Kingdom fryers with a liveweight of 1.7-1.8 kg are produced this way, using breeds such as the New Zealand White. The mother can be serviced before weaning, about 5-6 weeks after kindling, which allows 21/2 months between litters.
When feed is not quite adequate in quality or quantity, it is preferable to wean rabbits at about 40 days. At the same time the breeder should slightly lengthen the resting period between weaning and rebreeding so the doe can build up her reserves again. In any case, weaning later than 6 weeks offers no particular nutritional advantage. The milk produced by the doe after this period provides at most 3 to 5 percent of the young rabbits' daily feed intake.
* Semi-intensive rate
The breeder has does serviced 10-20 days after kindling and the young are weaned at 4-5 weeks. For 10-20 days the doe is newly pregnant while still nursing. The most important phase of embryo development takes place during the slump in milk production, which may even have ceased, so there is no real competition between the demands of gestation and lactation. As these does never have a resting period they need sufficient and well balanced concentrate feed.
* Intensive rate
The breeder has the does reserviced just after kindling, taking advantage of the fact that they are then in heat. Weaning should take place at 4 weeks at the latest' usually 26-28 days. There are 3 main techniques:
* servicing the same day or the day after kindling: the true post-partum rate;
* servicing scheduled for a specific day, generally 3 or 4 days after kindling. This corresponds to a constant interval of 35 days (5 weeks) between litters;
* ad lib. mating. A buck left together with post-partum does will serve them several times during the 48 hours following kindling. This is the natural rhythm of wild rabbits.
To arrange ad lib. mating, breeders have worked out 2 types of rabbit housing. The first is the corridor-collar type: the does live in individual cages. They have a broad collar around their necks to prevent them from leaving the cage through the calibrated opening leading into a communicating corridor. The buck, however, has free access (at least temporarily) to the does' cages and can mate whenever the doe is ready.
The second is the group system: a buck and perhaps 10 does live together in the same cage. They can mate at the optimum times. However, special arrangements must be made to curb the natural tendency of females to kill the offspring of other does when they themselves are lactating or ready to kindle.
Choosing the reproduction rate
Considering the greater nutritional needs of the pregnant doe, especially one which is also lactating, semi-intensive and intensive reproduction systems are only suitable where does get the right quantity and quality of feed. If these conditions are not met, the does will usually accept the male but will abort.
Abortion extends the interval between litters to make it as long as the extensive breeding interval. Figure 15 shows the main periods in the reproduction cycle and how under intensive reproduction the doe has no opportunity to build up reserves.
FIGURE 15.-Distribution of gestation, lactation and resting periods in does used at different rates of reproduction
Numerous comparisons of intensive and extensive reproduction have been made, principally in France. Ten years ago the litters of does mated post-partum numbered one less than those of does mated 10 or more days after kindling. This is virtually no longer true, mainly because of improved feeding and the selection of strains and lines suitable for intensive reproduction. Where it is feasible it is the most productive method, though also the most demanding.
In fact breeders in France, Italy and Spain adopt a variable rate of reproduction depending on the condition of the does. For instance, a good healthy doe which produces a litter of fewer than 7 or 8 is immediately remated. If she has given birth to 10 or so young the breeder waits about 12 days before having her serviced. In autumn, when it is harder to get the rabbits to mate, breeders systematically take the does for servicing after parturition. This is to take advantage of the strong post-partum oestrus during which 95-99 percent accept servicing.
In intensive reproduction in European rabbitries 1 doe can produce 5060 weaned young annually. At the same technological level 45-55 rabbits can be produced in a semi-intensive reproduction system. In a wet tropical climate, with balanced feeding, it is possible for a doe to produce 40-50 weaned young a year by a combination of intensive and semi-intensive rates.
Using the extensive rate the best breeders obtain 30-35 weaned young per doe per year. In a tropical climate, depending on the region and especially on feeding, 15-30 weaned young can be produced under extensive reproduction.

Conclusions
Domestication of the rabbit is relatively recent and most of today's breeds and populations have been bred by man in the last 200 to 300 years.
The rabbit has been used as an experimental animal in genetics and reproduction physiology since the beginning of the century, but it was not until 1950 that the first findings on quantitative genetics were published, in Venge's study of maternal influence on rabbit birth weight (Verge, 1950). This work opened the way for research on the genetic improvement of the rabbit for meat production. INRA scientists in France began research and development work in their area in 1961, followed by work in other research laboratories in many countries. The excellent bibliography by Robinson (1958), Genetic studies of the rabbit, giving reliable genetic and physiological bases, has already been dated by this new work.
A report on French research on rabbit selection in the 10 years from 1970 to 1980 was recently drawn up by Rouvier ( 1981). However, experience gained in European conditions cannot be transferred directly to developing countries. To upgrade their rabbits breeders should use the local animals, either native or from imported populations that have been acclimatized, and make use of the genetic variability that is available.
It does seem that priority should be given to research on rural and backyard rabbit production. These would be small, thrifty, autonomous units requiring little investment and using local resources. They would be reasonably productive.
Table 26 gives the taxonomic classification of the rabbit.
Genetics of rabbit breeds and populations
Perhaps the best of the various definitions of breed is Quittet's: "A breed is a collection of individuals within a species which share a certain number of morphological and physiological characters which are passed on to their progeny as long as they breed among themselves."
One way of assessing the genetic uniqueness of different breeds is to study their origins. A breed is the outcome of the combined impact of artificial and natural selection (environmental adaptation). It is difficult to define, and its background can be difficult to trace. Artificial selection may be based on a number of different criteria, not necessarily all to do with productivity. Animals may be selected in artificial or natural conditions, the environment may gradually change, and so on.

Rabbit breeds or populations can also be defined in terms of gene frequencies. This is possible with genes identifiable through their visible or major effects on progeny. Coloration and hair structure are classified as visible effects. Thanks to advanced observation techniques the genes governing blood groups, biochemical and protein polymorphism and hereditary anomalies are now also known.
Rabbit populations can also be defined in terms of the strength of breeding stock, natural selection trends, origin and geographical area, and characteristics of breeds, strains, inbred lines and local populations -quantitative characters affected by large numbers of genes that cannot be pinpointed individually.
Rabbit chromosomes carry 2n = 44 genes. Genes situated at 70 loci are known and 6 linkage groups have been established. Among the known loci roughly one-third concern the coat (colour, hair structure), one-third govern blood groups and the production of antibodies, and most of the rest govern hereditary diseases.
The rabbit can support a slow and gradual increase in inbreeding, hut research suggests that mating programmes for small populations should minimize its extent and rate of increase among the stock.
Breeds created by selectors, amateurs and fanciers in the United States and, especially, western Europe now conform to official standards. The book of the Société centrale d'aviculture de France (SCAF) on standards for rabbits describes 44 breeds. They have been bred from animals of local and regional populations, or by crossing breeds, or using mutants for changes in coat colour or structure. Mass selection for size and body morphology has separated these breeds into giant, medium, small and very small.
The characters by which an animal conforms to a breeding standard, such as body size, whether or not it is compact, coat colour and density, and ear size, may be related to its resistance to variations in climate. In fact, such factors as coat, skin, body area and weight affect the animals' body temperature.
The currently known genetic determinants of variations in colour and structure are listed below. Coat colour has always been of great interest to breeders.
Coat colour and hair structure
In The genetics of domestic rabbits, published in 1930, Castle described 6 mutations in coat colour and 2 mutations in pattern; 3 mutations in hair structure; 1 mutation in the yellow colouring of the abdominal fat, and 2 linkage groups. A convenient way to detect the effects of various mutations is to describe the rabbit's "wild" colouring. The coat consists of 3 types of hair: the longer, rectrix guard hairs, stiff at the base; the more numerous tectrix barbed hairs forming the major part of the coat, which share a hair follicle with the third type-the shorter hairs making up the undercoat.
The wild coat colour, the so-called agouti, consists of grey dorsal fur with a much lighter or white ventral area. The long guard hairs are black but appear deeper black at the tips and bluer at the base. The barbed hairs have zones of colour: black at the tips, with a yellow band in the middle and bluish at the base. The fibres of the underfur are bluish at the base and fringed with yellow at the tips. Colouring is thus basically due to the distribution of black and yellow pigments (eumelanin and phaeomelanin) in the hair, especially in the barbed hairs, and over the whole coat (sides and back in relation to belly fur). Mutations in different loci modify this colouring.
* Colouring
Locus A, agouti: the nonagouti mutation a produces animals without a yellow band in the hair and a lighter belly. Their colouring is uniform. A is dominant over a. A third allele has been described at this locus, a' (tan pattern), which is recessive to A and dominant over a.
Locus B, black pigment: a recessive b allele produces a chocolate brown pigment instead of black in agouti hair. This mutation is one of the latest to be discovered (1900).
Locus C: the C gene is required for the development of pigments in the fur, skin and eyes and hence for the expression of colouring. The recessive c gene inhibits the expression of colouring, causing albinism in recessive cc homozygotes. There are several alleles at this locus, quoted below in dominant-to-recessive order:
C full expression of colouring.
c^ch chinchilla, suppression of colour in the intermediate band of the coat.
c^h Himalayan. Only the hairs at the body extremities are black. The expression of this gene depends on the ambient temperature.
c albinism.
The albinism locus is epistatic over the colour loci. The cc genotype covers the expression of colour genes situated at other loci.
Dilution, D, d: the recessive mutant d allele affects the intensity of the pigmentation, causing a dilution of the pigment granules. The dominant D allele produces normal pigmentation density. The recessive dd homozygote is found in the genotypes of blue (black diluted to blue) or beige (yellow diluted to beige) rabbits.
Normal extension of black (E) or yellow (e): the e gene mutation causes increased yellow pigment in the hair, tending to replace the black (or brown) pigment. Grey, black or brown breeds have the E gene. Yellow and red breeds are recessive ee homozygotes.
Vienna White locus: Vienna White rabbits have completely unpigmented fur but coloured eyes (blue). The original gene is called V and its mutated form v. Rabbits of the Vienna White breed are therefore recessive vv homozygotes. Crosses of this breed with albino rabbits produce coloured progeny.
Mutations producing a mottled coat: these mutations involve the loci for English (En, en) and Dutch (Du, au). The Papillon rabbit is of the En en heterozygous genotype. The En gene is incompletely dominant. The En En homozygotes are whiter than the heterozygotes, while recessive homozygotes are blacker. The colour genotype of the Papillon rabbit (Giant Checker in English, Mariposa in Spanish) cannot be pinpointed. At the other locus the du du genotype produces the white belt characteristic of the Dutch rabbit.
* Hair structure mutations
Angora: this recessive mutation produces unusually long hair. The normal length L dominant gene has mutated into a recessive l gene to produce the Angora. The mating of two Angora rabbits always produces Angora offspring. Two rabbits with normal hair can sometimes produce a fraction of Angora progeny if they are Ll heterozygotes.
Rex: this recessive mutation produces the reverse effect, unusually short hair. The symbol for the Rex gene is r and for the dominant allele R.
Hairlessness: this is caused by a recessive mutation and is usually lethal.
The genotype of the coat colour and structure in rabbit breeds can be predicted when these loci are known. So far not much gene interaction visibly affecting body colour and breeding characters has been found, but there has been very little research in this area. The function of the Angora and Rex genes, of course, is to produce Angora wool and Rex fur.
Groups of breeds by adult size and origin
There are different kinds of breeds:
* primitive or primary, and geographic, from which all other breeds have come
* breeds obtained through artificial selection from the above, such as Burgundy Fawn, New Zealand White and Red, Champagne d'Argent
* synthetic breeds obtained by planned crosses of several breeds, such as Blanc du Bouscat, Californian-Mendelian breeds, obtained by the fixation of a new character of simple genetic determination, appear by mutation, such as Castorrex, Satin, Japanese.
Breeds are conveniently grouped by adult size, which is also related to production characters such as precocity, prolificacy, growth rate and age at maturity. A major determinant of adult size is the origin of the breed.
* Heavy breeds
Adult weight exceeds 5 kg. The growth potential of the heavy breeds can be exploited, especially in crossbreeding. The Bouscat Giant White, French Lop, Flemish Giant and French Giant Papillon are examples. The fur of the Lop varies greatly in colour and can be white, agouti, iron grey, or black. Its body build would make it a good meat rabbit. However, it is bred for show and therefore found only in small units, at least in France. The breed is more important in other European countries such as the Federal Republic of Germany and Denmark.
The Bouscat Giant White is a synthetic albino breed. It is a large rabbit known for its prolificacy and fast growth rate in traditional French rabbitries. The Flemish Giant from Belgium comes in several colours. It is one of the largest rabbits (potential adult weight 7 kg) and is still farm-raised. This breed could furnish a gene pool for improving growth in other breeds; Flemish Giants could be purebred for this purpose.
* Average breeds
Adult weight varies from 3.5 to 4.5 kg. These are the basic stock of breeds used for intensive rabbit production for meat in western Europe and are the most numerous. Only a few examples are described here.
Silver rabbits are found in several countries (English Silver, German Silver). These varieties differ from the Champagne d'Argent in adult size (English Silver is lighter) and colour. Like Burgundy Fawn, Champagne d'Argent is an example of a breed that has developed with selection over many years from a regional population (Champagne). The breed is known for both its fur, once much sought after? and its productivity: high fertility, quick growth, good muscle development and good meat quality. Its adult weight is 4-4.5 kg. It is farm-bred in France, usually on straw litter. Research has begun on intensive breeding of Champagne d'Argent.
The Burgundy Fawn is also of regional origin . It has spread throughout France and elsewhere in Europe (Italy, Belgium, Switzerland). The Burgundy Fawn Rabbit Breeders' Association has established a stud book for this breed, ensuring purebred selection.
The New Zealand Red was first developed in California, with a system of selection very similar to that used in France on the Burgundy Fawn, with the difference that the New Zealand breed was raised on wire-mesh floors which were introduced much earlier in the United States than they were in France.
The Californian is a synthetic American breed. It was presented for the first time in 1928 in California by its breeder, whose objective was a meat animal with very good fur. The adult weight of the Californian is 3.6-4 kg.
The New Zealand White originated as a breed in the United States. It is the albino offspring of coloured rabbits. From the outset it was bred selectively in large meat-production units, especially in southern California (San Diego area), for its breeding qualities: prolificacy, maternal performance, fast growth rate and precocious body development which makes it ready for slaughter at 56 days, the objective being a light carcass. The New Zealand White adult weight (4 kg) slightly exceeds that of the Californian. The New Zealand White was used in the the first studies on the rabbit at the Fontana Station in California (Rollins and Casady, 1967). Since 1960 this breed has spread through western Europe and other regions with the growing use of mesh floors for rabbit cages.
The Grand Chinchilla rabbit raised in Europe is of German origin. Its adult weight averages 4.5 kg. It can be bred for meat and fur.
* Lightweight breeds
These breeds have an adult weight of 2.5-3 kg. They include the Himalayan, the Small Chinchilla, the Dutch and the French Havana.
The Russian or Himalayan rabbit is white with black extremities. It is thought to have originated in China and spread from there to the USSR and Poland. It carries the Himalayan C" gene mutation. A strain of these rabbits bred in a French rabbitry has shown a strong rate of ovulation. This seems to be a biological characteristic of the strain, which is now being raised at the INRA centre at Toulouse.
The lightweight breeds usually develop very quickly and make excellent mothers. They eat less than the medium and large breeds and could be crossed or used pure in developing countries to produce a light, meaty carcass of 1-1 .2 kg.
* Small breeds
These breeds weigh about 1 kg at maturity. They are represented chiefly by the Polish rabbit, with its many variations of coat colour. Selection for small size has led to very low fertility and a marked decrease in growth rate. These breeds cannot be used for meat production. They are bred for show, for the laboratory and as pets.
Local populations and strains
Purebred animals are usually raised in small groups, and their selection for breeding characters is in its infancy. These breeds could therefore constitute interesting potential gene pools for improving local populations.
Most rabbits raised for commercial meat production belong to populations which may resemble one breed or another (a question of appearance only, as they do not meet the criteria for that particular breed in terms of origin and standards) and sometimes resemble no breed at all. These are "Common" rabbits-grey, spotted or white-the outcome of various unplanned crosses. They may belong to local populations. Some examples of local populations in developing countries are the Baladi rabbit of Sudan (baladi means native or local in Arabic), the Maltese rabbit of Tunisia and the Creole rabbit of Guadeloupe. Countries planning to develop rabbit production should first identify existing local populations and research their biological and breeding traits and adaptability before designing selection programmes and suitable production systems.
Finally, there are rabbit strains. The strain is a genetically closed group, small in number, with no outbreeding for several generations. Characteristics of a strain are the number of breeding animals, the year and way the group was constituted, and possibly the mating programme (selection or no selection). These strains can be found in research laboratories which keep them to study their biological and breeding characteristics in order to make the best use of them in selection. The INRA centre in Toulouse conducts selection experiments on strains (Table 27).
Private breeders have fairly recently begun selecting rabbit strains, along the lines of the poultry selection that has been practiced since 1930. But some breeders or small groups of breeders, at village level for instance, may also have created strains without realizing it.
Some research laboratories, such as the Jackson Laboratory at Bar Harbor, Maine, keep inbred rabbit strains or lines for use solely as laboratory animals.

Breeding characters
The expression of breeding characters depends on environment and the breeder. A comparison of results from several different environments and geographical locations can reveal general characteristics of the breeds or species. Prolificacy, growth rate, and tissue development in young rabbits are three sets of basic breeding characters.
* Prolificacy
Prolificacy is measured by the number of live births or total births per litter. It varies significantly according to several factors which may be inherent in the animal. Litter size increases by 10-20 percent from the first to the second litter, increases again but less from the second to the third, with no change from the third to the fourth. After the fourth the size may decrease. Inbreeding may reduce prolificacy.

Californian (5 references) 7.6
Chinchilla (5 references) 6.8
Large Himalayan ( 1 reference) 3.7

Flemish Giant (3 references) 8.1
Prolificacy also depends on the season and the reproductive rate imposed on the doe. In healthy does receiving normal feed and 12-14 hours light, prolificacy seems to be linked to adult size. Ovulation potential does increase, on the average, with size. The first factor affecting prolificacy is the ovulation rate (number of eggs) followed by the viability of blastocysts and embryos before birth.
Gregory (1932) said litter size depends on the number of eggs produced after mating and this number depends on the body size of the breed: 3.97 for Polish does and 12.88 for the Flemish Giant. The corresponding litter sizes at birth are 3.24 and 10.17. Small light breeds are generally less prolific than medium and large breeds. The prolificacy of the Small Himalayan breed raised by INRA at Toulouse is 6.7 total births and 6.3 live births per litter. Elamin (1978) gives these average figures from the Sudan for the Baladi, Californian and New Zealand White breeds:
New Zealand
Baladi Californian White
Litter size 4.7 7.10 7.49
Live births per litter 3.5 6.67 6.94
Table 28 shows variations in doe prolificacy among breeds of different adult sizes. This table is mainly based on old data from Pickard (1930). While only a small number of breeds are represented there does appear to be a positive correlation between adult size and prolificacy.

Total young Live births At 21 strays At 56 strays

A comparison of fertility among medium-size breeds reveals few differences. The following figures are in communications from the Genetics and Reproduction Section of the Second International Rabbit Breeding Congress, held at Barcelona in 1980, for New Zealand and Californian breeds researched in Spain by Garcia et al. (1980).

Comparable values are given by Rouvier et al. ( 1973) from checks of on-farm performances for Burgundy Fawn (unit 1) and New Zealand White (units 2-7) in Table 29.
Paez Campos et al. ( 1980) give the breeding parameters of New Zealand White, Californian, Chinchilla and Rex breeds raised at the National Rabbit Breeding Centre at Irapuato in Mexico, a tropical zone tempered by an altitude of 1 800 metres (Table 30).

Total births Live births
Semi-Giant White 9.3 8.2
Californian 7.S 6.6
New Zealand White 7.0 6.2
Chinchilla 7.6 6.4
The high rate of still-births ( 11.6 percent) is explained by rearing conditions in the rabbitry.
Among the medium-sized breeds, doe prolificacy averages 7-8 young in widely varying countries and climates. This character is thus relatively independent of climate.
* Biological components of prolificacy
Prolificacy does seem to be a breed-linked character, basically independent of climatic conditions. However, this conclusion is based on only a few breeds. Many local breeds and populations are still not very well known. Once the ovulation potential and embryonic viability of these breeds are discovered the best strategy for upgrading them (pure or crossbreeding) under local conditions can be planned.
The study methodology has been established by Hulot and Matheron ( 1981) at the INRA Animal Genetic Improvement Station in Toulouse. The authors examined the numbers of corpus luteum, implantation sites and 16-day embryos of does ovulating after mating. These does came from two strains, one of New Zealand White and the other of Californian and Large Himalayan, established in 1966. The purpose of the experiment was to study nulliparous does (first litter), primiparous does (second litter) and multiparous does (third-fourth litters). Each group was fairly well represented at all seasons of the year. Table 31 shows that does of the Californian strain ovulated more often than the New Zealand White (difference of two eggs), but they later lost far more eggs, so the difference in the number of embryos counted 12 days after mating (genital tract removed by laparotomy) was not significant.
The does are reared in a rational French management system at semi intensive reproductive rates: the nulliparous does are serviced at 150 + 10 days. Those which kindle are mated again during lactation 10 or 11 days after kindling. Prolificacy rates observed for the two strains are not very different, with a slight superiority so far (but not in this study) for the New Zealand White. Prolificacy could be used as a universal criterion to describe breeds or strains if it were calculated from female acceptance of the buck rather than the number of kindlings per doe.
While prolificacy does seem to be a sure characteristic of breed or population, which offers the added advantage of being measurable in a large production unit, ovulation rate is much more characteristic of a breed. Ovulation rate also indicates the maximum biological potential for prolificacy. The potential biological equilibrium between ovulation rate and egg viability in a breed should therefore be examined.
The data in Table 31 refer only to the two strains studied and cannot be applied to other rabbit populations. They do suggest a possible study approach for developing countries into the prolificacy of local rabbits- the identification of populations with high ovulation potential and high embryo viability could suggest possible crosses to combine these two advantages for improved fertility.

* Weight gain and anatomical composition
The growth rates of young rabbits are strongly correlated with adult size and weight where there has been no marked dietary deficiency. Table 32 gives average weights of young rabbits at successive ages, from 28 to 78 days, as well as carcass weights at 78 days, for the Small Himalayan and New Zealand White. The table clearly shows the growth rate of young Small Himalayan rabbits (adult weight of breed 2.5 kg) to be slower than that of the New Zealand White breed (adult weight 4 kg). Moreover, at 78 days the New Zealand White is more mature than the Small Himalayan, when its liveweight is 63 percent of adult weight against 59 percent for the Small Himalayan. The coefficients of variation (v%). the ratio of the standard phenotype deviation from the mean, are typical of the intrabreed variability of these characters for a given feeding system. Variability is greater in young New Zealand White rabbits than in Small Himalayan. Medium breeds slaughtered at the same age also vary
in growth performance and carcass composition. Table 33 gives data for young Burgundy Fawn, Champagne d'Argent and Large Himalayan rabbits slaughtered at 84 days. Champagne d'Argent has excellent growth, muscle tissue and fat development for meat production. Burgundy Fawn is a close second.

Source:Rouvier, 1970
Weight gain and the growth rate of the main tissues depend on the breed's biological characteristics and on production factors such as feeding. So the criterion for describing a breed in a particular production environment should probably be maturity in terms of weight, defined as weight at a given age divided by adult weight. The most interesting breeds from the production point of view are those with the best ratio of weight gain to adult weight, and which arrive early at the proper liveweight for market. Lightweight breeds could be utilized as purebreds or, better, crossed with medium-weight breeds for a light carcass with good muscle development and quality meat (sufficient fat) where there is consumer demand.
Genetics of breeding characters
The genetic improvement of breeding characters relevant to the production environment depends on the specific genetic variability expressed in that environment. This variability is expressed in animals of the same breed or local population as well as in different breeds and populations and in interpopulation crosses. Variability is an expression of genetic differences which selection and crossing try to exploit.
The question here is how genetic variability can be exploited in small scale production, preferably using local resources. Upgrading the potential of a species depends on its biological characteristics, the mastery of its reproduction and calculating the genetic parameters for selection.

Biological characters
* Controlled breeding
One breeding operation requiring much care and time on the breeder's part is to get the first and successive litters from the doe. In cage breeding the doe should be serviced in the buck's cage. Once sexually mature the doe can theoretically be presented to the buck at any time except during gestation, but in practice she does not always accept the male. Acceptance of the male and subsequent mating produce litters only 70 percent of the time. This figure varies with physiological conditions, season, breed and environment. Figure 16 summarizes the respective genetic roles of the buck and the doe in litter size at weaning.

^1 Data from a rational rabbit production unit in the Midi-Pyrénées region of France.
The breeder is dependent on the sexual urges of the buck and doe for the first essential step, the mating. Little is known about the biological basis of rabbit sexuality. The urge drops with high temperatures (2830°C). In the hot season the doe must be presented to the buck early in the morning, from 06.00 onwards, when the sexual urge is greater.
Fertility is affected by ovulation, which depends on the doe and takes place 10 hours after mating, and by fecondation of the egg, which depends on the buck and occurs 16 hours after mating. The genes of both the buck and the doe equally affect pre-natal growth and the viability of the egg. Crossing can improve the viability of the egg, blastocyst and embryo. The doe has more influence in the uterine environment, notably on embryo nourishment. The buck therefore has an influence on litter size.
Once the doe has kindled, the litter must be safely raised to weaning. The breeder affects litter size at weaning by protecting the young and by the feed provided for the nursing doe. The viability of the baby rabbits, maternal behaviour and milk production are also important. Kindling weaning viability in the litter depends on the number of live births, which varies from breed to breed, as shown in Table 34.
This viability remains fairly constant for the number of live births in litters of 3-9. Small litters ( 1-2 live births) do not offer a favourable environment for the survival of the young. Live young at weaning peak at 8.60 for litters of 12 or more. This suggests practical rules for fostering to increase the total production of young rabbits weaned. Up to 3 young can be fostered by 'good" mothers. The fostered rabbits may come from small (12), or more commonly from large (over 10) litters. However, fostering implies both a sufficient number of does in the rabbitry. and the breeder's familiarity with their maternal behaviour.
The biological characteristics of the female rabbit -ovulation brought on by mating, acceptance of the male from the day of kindling, no lactation anoestrus, no marked seasonal anoestrus-are such as to afford a wide range of theoretical reproduction rates. As an example, Table 35 compares 3 different rates of reproduction at a commercial rabbit breeding centre in Mexico.
Both does and bucks have a very high reproduction potential, as confirmed by the latest research. Potential reproduction per doe per year can be evaluated at 150 young. Achieving this, however, will require many more years of research as well as the mastery of environmental factors. For breeding in developing countries it is best at present to aim at using local populations and longer reproductive periods. The thing is to start by upgrading traditional production techniques.
* Tissue growth
As demonstrated by Cantier et al. (1969) bone tissue in rabbits develops first, followed by muscle and then fat. In a population of common rabbits of average adult weight (4 kg) the skeleton develops rapidly up to a liveweight of 900 g. Growth then continues more slowly up to 4 kg. Muscle tissue gains very quickly in weight up to a liveweight of 2.3-2.6 kg, when the curve falls abruptly. Adipose tissue develops at a fast rate after 2.2 kg. To allow for the differences in the speed of overall weight gain due to breed or feeding, rabbits should be slaughtered at 50-60 percent of the normal adult weight for their breed or population. This is the right stage for the best anatomical composition of the carcass and the most efficient utilization of feed.

A poor feed slows down overall weight gain and lowers conversion efficiency-the amount of feed necessary to produce a 1 kg weight gain. This might not be a drawback in a breeding system using local resources for feeding the growing rabbits, but the fastest-growing animals in a population have the best carcass composition (muscle/bone ratio, fat percentage) at slaughter age or weight. Young rabbit meat is naturally lean; there is no excess fat. The best slaughter age and weight must be worked out in terms of market demand. the production system and the type of feed used.
Genes and the environment
Most quantitative breeding characters-fertility, viability, growth, etc-are polygenetically determined. but they are also subject to the effects of the environment. Phenotype is the outcome of the impact of genotype and environment on a character. The genotype is the outcome of the effects of genes at several loci. The environment is made up of a number of components: climate, habitat, the animals' microclimate, temperature. humidity, air speed, the rabbitry equipment, breeding techniques and feeding practices, and the human factor-the breeder. The genetic determination of character variations is of dual interest to the selector and breeder: first. to exploit the genetic variability of animals of the same breed or population; and second, by crossing, to exploit the genetic variability between breeds and populations.
* Genetic variability in animals of the same population
Individual genotypic values are not directly observable, only phenotypes can be measured. From the beginning quantitative genetics has used the simple model P = m + G + E, where:
m is the general average of the character in a population
P is the phenotype of the character
G is the genotype of the character expressed in such a way that mean value for individuals of the population is nil
E is the effect of the environment expressed in such a way that mean average value for individuals of the population is nil.
This model assumes genotype and environment to be independent. There are three ways in which genes affect genotype. First, each gene acts individually and the additive effect is called A. Second, two genes at the same locus may interact, producing a dominant effect called D. Dominance occurs when the heterozygotous genotype has a different, generally higher value than the average of two dominant and recessive homozygotous genotypes. Third, when several loci are involved, the genes at one locus may interact (alone or in pairs) with genes at another locus. Epistasis (I) then occurs. The total genotypic value G thus breaks down as: G = A + D + I.
A population of animals is selected on the basis of the estimated additive genetic value of the breeding animals expressed through phenotype regression.
The amount of genetic progress that can be expected from intrapopulation selection depends especially on the coefficient of additive genetic value on the phenotypic value heritability (h^2), or inheritance of character. This regression coefficient is equal to the ratio additive genetic variance (s^2[G])/phenotypic variance (s^2p). This fundamental parameter of genetics and selection, between 0 and 1, is governed by character, population and environment. Data on the heritability of characters are much more complete for other domestic mammals and chickens than for rabbits, which have received proportionately less attention from researchers. Table 36 gives some indicative figures for rabbit characters of economic importance.
In Table 37 Rouvier gives the figures on heritability for young rabbits in a crossed population. They were fed balanced pelleted feed ad lib. and reared in a protected environment. Theoretically, these conditions favour the expression of genetic variability.

There are virtually no estimates on the heritability of rabbit breeding characters for populations in warm and tropical climates except the work of Rollins et a/. (1963) in California. The authors examined the genetic variability of rabbit mortality rates between days 15 and 56 (weaning) in New Zealand White rabbits at the Fontana Experimental Station. In this age group overall mortality was 12 percent, mainly from enteritis and pneumonia. The heritable paternal component of this mortality was h^2 = 0.12 ± 0.02. The heritable maternal component was h^2 = 0.45 ± 0.05 for the mortality from enteritis and h^2 = 0.58 ± 0.05 for the mortality from pneumonia. This indicates a significant additive genetic variability for mortality or viability of young rabbits for the two main causes of death detected at this centre-enteritis and pneumonia. The maternal component of heritability proved far superior to the paternal. This reflects the mother's impact on the viability of the young.
In working out a selection programme, as well as the heritability of characters their phenotypic and genetic correlations need to be known. Concerning phenotypes, there is a positive correlation between total litter weight and litter size at birth and weaning. There is, however, a negative correlation between the individual weights of young rabbits and litter size at birth. Thus, the correlation between individual weight and litter size at 28 days is r =-0.6.
The effect on growth of litter size at birth was first demonstrated by Venge ( 1950). It shows in the weight of the rabbits at successive ages up to 12 weeks. There is no linear ratio, however, between weaning to slaughter growth rate and litter size.
The rg genetic correlations between growth rate and individual weight at 28 days (weaning) and at 70 days are respectively rg = 0.35 and rg = 0.93. The genetic correlation between the growth rate and carcass weight (slaughter at 11 weeks) is rg = 0.87. Selection can thus affect average daily growth rate from weaning to slaughter. A response to selection for this character would include correlated responses on weaning and slaughter weights.
There is a genetic correlation between average post-weaning daily growth rate and the intake of pelleted feed (rg = 0.7 to 0.8). Intake is also heritable, which indicates that appetite is heritable. Selection for post-weaning growth amounts to selecting those rabbits which have best adapted to weaning stress, and have the best appetites and greatest viability.
In conclusion it should be recalled that expression of genotype and additive genetic value can depend on the environment. This raises the question of choosing the selection environment according to the production environment and how breeding stock is used (pure breeds or crosses). The interaction between genotype and environment is still not clear for rabbits because genotypes have only been compared in a single type of environment. As environmental differences are likely to be much greater in developing countries, this interaction should be given careful attention in research.
* Genetic variability among breeds and populations
The comparison of breeds raised in the same environment may reveal breeding peculiarities traceable to differences in the average genotype values of animals belonging to different breeds. Interbreed comparisons in rabbitries are therefore very useful. Local breeds and populations can be compared with improved breeds in other countries and breeds produced in different conditions. Interbreed differences are basically exploited through crosses. Not all crosses are advantageous. however; they must be tested. The main advantages of crossbreeding are Heterosis and interbreed nicking ability.
Heterosis may be defined as better average breeding performances of crossed animals than of the two pure parent breeds. Heterosis may apply to the young rabbit (its viability, for example), the crossed doe (fertility, milk production) or the crossed buck (vigour, sexual urge, fertility). Characters subject to dominance, such as reproduction characters, are those most likely to benefit from heterosis.
Heterosis may occur where the populations crossed differ genetically, which is not always revealed by a phenotypic study of the pure breeds or populations. The crossed animals are always more heterotic than the animals of the 2 parent populations, and this implies greater adaptability to variable and difficult environmental conditions. Crossing can therefore be useful in improving rabbit breeding in developing countries, but crossing trials must be planned. Where local populations exist their use is recommended.
TABLE 38.-GAINS IN PRODUCTIVITY IN E LITTER CHARACTERS DUE TO SIMPLE (2-BREE D) AND 3-BREED 2-FACTOR CROSSBREEDING
Table 38 shows increases in prolificacy, number of young weaned, kindling-weaning viability and litter weight at weaning, obtained by 2-and 3breed crosses. Averages are for the 4 breeds used in experimental breeding at INRA, Toulouse.
There can be a 12 percent gain in prolificacy due to heterosis in the simple crossing of 2 breeds (better viability of crossed eggs and embryos). Another 6 percent is added by crossing 3 breeds (improved fertility of crossed does). The gain in number of young weaned per litter is even greater: 15 percent for simple crosses, plus 10 percent for 3-breed crosses. This means a 25 percent overall increase from the pure breed to double-stage crossing with 3 breeds using a crossed doe. Heterosis affecting kindling-weaning viability thus joins heterosis affecting prolificacy by increasing litter size at weaning. The result is an effect of heterosis on the total weight of the weaned litter (considering the correration with litter size). So the simple-crossed young rabbits are more vigorous and the crossed does produce more milk.
Crossbreeding makes possible the optimum use of the nicking ability of the breeds or populations crossed. Nicking ability concerns the 2 groups of characters from the mother and her young which contribute to the quantity of rabbit meat produced by the doe. In crossbreeding this ability is aimed at bringing together either the overall characters relative to the mother and the offspring, or a favourable combination of additive effects on the components of an overall character.
In the first instance, bucks of a breed with high growth potential are crossed with does of another breed or population that exhibit good prolificacy, maternal performance and tolerance of the production environment. The second instance concerns traits making up an overall character. Thus, ovulation rate and egg and embryo viability are components of litter size at birth (prolificacy). Prolificacy and birth-weaning viability are components of litter size at weaning. Crosses can therefore be sought which combine a high ovulation rate and strong embryo viability in the crossed doe. These characters may well be antagonistic on an intrapopulation basis.
The effects of heterosis and nicking ability are not systematic. Crossing programmes are needed to bring out these effects clearly. It is recommended that two reciprocal crosses of each breed or population combination be compared to discover the effects of the maternal and grand-maternal generations. It is also recommended that 2 successive generations of crosses be studied to find the direct heterotic effects on the characters of the young rabbits, the impact on the does, and the effects of the preceding maternal generations.
Where n breeds or populations are available for study, a complete crossing programme will include: in the first generation, n^2mating of bucks and does of the same n breeds. In the second generation, the female progeny of these n^2 genetic types will be mated with the male offspring of an (n + 1 )^th population.
Where males are to be compared the n2 male genetic types obtained from the first crosses should be used with a single female population. The main interest in such a study would be the effects of heterosis on the characters of sexual urge and fertility in the buck.
The result of experiments at INRA, Toulouse, in 1970-72 provide an example. Table 39 shows the paternal and maternal effects on the litters of crosses between Burgundy Fawn (BF), Champagne d'Argent (CA), Bouscat Giant White (BGW), Californian (CL), New Zealand White (NZW) and Small Himalayan (SH) males, mated in accordance with a factorial scheme, with does of the 3 breeds CL, NZW, and SH.
The best buck breeds for the characters researched were Burgundy Fawn and Champagne d'Argent. This offers an answer to the question of what breed of male to cross with several female populations (here, the CL, NZW and SH breeds). In choosing a doe crossbred for productivity and the effects of the doe's parental stock, the breeds of the doe's sire and dam should be analysed in terms of their impact as well as the heterotic effect on maternal impact. Table 40 gives the findings for the CL, NZW and SH breeds.

The does of the 9 genetic types resulting from the factorial crossing of the CL, NZW and SH breeds were all mated with Burgundy Fawn bucks. The progeny of does mated with this breed or with Champagne d'Argent have the highest weights at weaning. Of the 3 breeds compared in crossings to improve litter size and weight at weaning, the Californian should be used as the sire (+0.5 rabbits weaned) and the New Zealand White as the dam (+0.5 rabbits weaned, +303 g total litter weight at weaning) for a productive crossed doe.
The effects of heterosis must also be studied when choosing a crossed doe. For each pair of breeds considered the heterotic effect is measured by the difference between the average of the 2 genetic types of the reciprocal crossed does and the average of the purebred does of the 2 breeds, expressed as a percentage of the general average of the character (Table 41).

The crossing of a Californian sire and a New Zealand White dam does not produce heterosis. The attraction is the favourable combination of the additive effects of the sire and the dam. Reciprocal crossing, however, is not advantageous. Concerning the litter characters of the crossed doe CL x NZW, there is a favourable combination of direct genetic effects on the ovulation rate transmitted by the sire and the effects of the maternal line of the dam. It has been confirmed that the ovulation rate in the Californian strain of the sire exceeds the New Zealand White strain by 2 eggs.

Crossed does with Small Himalayan dams show heterosis: a doe with a Californian sire and a Small Himalayan dam has a bigger, heavier litter at weaning. Table 42 shows the estimated effects of each of the 9 genetic types, expressed in deviations from the mean. These estimates show specific performances for the strain combinations, tracing the additive genetic and heterotic effects on the characters of the litters.
The findings of crossing trials are very useful in planning breeding programmes, but they only apply to the animal populations studied and cannot be applied to all the animals of a particular breed. But they could typify local populations or strains of the breed and thus be used in selecting for pure- and crossbreeding.
* Crossbreeding in tropical countries
The biological bases for superior crosses should be sought among the available animal populations bred in various environments. The only known large-scale studies of interbreed crosses in tropical countries are from Cuba (wet tropics) and Mexico (dry tropics, tempered by altitude).
These studies were made on animals from imported acclimatized breeds, not on local rabbit populations. Meat production was improved by using the best crosses. In 1969-71 the Cuban Instituto de Ciencia Animal crossed 4 breeds on a rotational basis: Semi-Giant White, Californian, New Zealand White and Chinchilla. The characters analysed were litter size at birth and weaning, and litter weight at weaning. The experiment was conducted during the dry season (November-April, mean temperature 22.2°C, humidity 75.2 percent) and the rainy season (mean temperature 26.1°C, humidity 77.7 percent). Some of the experimental animals from these 4 breeds had recently been imported from Canada, others had been in Cuba for some time. Adult weights were:
Breed Weight of females (kg) Weight of males (kg)
Semi-Giant White 4.05 3.95
Californian 4.05 3.87
New Zealand 3.80 3.90
Chinchilla 3.98 4.20
The animals were raised in hutches identical to those used for rabbit breeding in Southern California. These are wire cages with wooden nesting boxes arranged in single decks in 2 rows, in a roofed building open on all 4 sides. This habitat protects the rabbits from direct sun but in a wet tropical climate cannot protect against rain and wind, which explains the high mortality rate of the rabbits before weaning.
An extensive system of reproduction was used, with weaning at 45 days, followed by mating. The average figures on litter size show a normal prolificacy for breeds of this adult size (7.45 total births per litter); slightly higher than normal stillbirth rate (over 10 percent); and above all a high birth to weaning mortality (2.5 rabbits weaned per litter). This was caused by inadequate protection of the nests from wind and rain and inadequate feeding of the lactating does. It is interesting to note the advantages of crossbreeding in such difficult production conditions.
A comparison among the pure breeds revealed that the Semi-Giant White loses fewer young between kindling and weaning than the others, and the weaning weight is better. For simple crosses the highest averages for number of young weaned and lowest total rabbit mortality figures were recorded by NZW x Semi-Giant White. Numerical productivity can also be increased by crossing the female progeny of this cross with Californian males. The most productive cross is Semi-Giant White does x Chinchilla bucks.
These findings show how important it is to experiment for the best results with purebreds and crossbreds where several breeds are available for trials.

Genetic improvement: selection and crossing
Selection-crossing schemes developed for intensive breeding on a commercial scale in temperate climates are not necessarily the most appropriate for backyard rabbitries, having been designed for a quite different purpose.
A small unit may have from 10 to 60 breeding does. Local populations and populations bred locally from imported sires and dams of different breeds should be used to upgrade the stock.
Effective genetic improvement in this context should be a group effort with scientific and technical support from the country's research and development organizations. The improvement programme could focus on a village or preferably a group of villages, or on all the rabbitries in a province or the whole country.
Genetic improvement demands technical specialization. There should therefore be breeder-selectors with larger units of 100 to 200 does who work together to coordinate the selection methodology with the support of research and development services. The selectors should be excellent breeders themselves, using production systems that are well adapted to local conditions and resources. Sophisticated equipment should not be used. The point is that selective breeding should be conducted in conditions in line with those of the best commercial rabbitries in the country. Health care and sanitation, in particular, must be exemplary.
A selection unit must be effective on 2 levels: breeding and production. The extra costs entailed by the technical side of the selection work should be borne by the group of breeders benefiting from the genetic improvement. The cost of research devoted to a genetic improvement programme for the whole country should be shared by a larger group.
For developing countries interested in developing rabbit production, there are two ways to organize selection. It can be done by government organizations or by breeders using a programme devised by government organizations.
The first system is used in Mexico. Selection is carried out by the Dirección General de Avicultura y Especies Menores, which has cooperated with INRA in France since 1976. This method is not incompatible with the second which can be promoted at the same time if interested breeder-selectors can be found.
Group research agencies working on selection should first determine whether the selection methods being used are truly effective, and create new genetic material to upgrade national production. They should then devise strategies for the best use of local and imported animals, and make comparative studies of the different breeds and crossbreeding experiments.
The object of selection is to upgrade performance by enhancing an animal's genetic value where breeding and feeding techniques permit expression of genetic value. In fact, breeding and feeding techniques must be improved at the same time as the genetic value. Selection and crossbreeding should increase the annual output per doe and speed the growth rate for earlier slaughter and better carcass and meat quality.
Crossing is a supplementary benefit to intrapopulation selection. But genetic progress from crossbreeding is not cumulative from one generation to the next as is progress from selection, except where selection is used to improve crossing.
SELECTION METHODS
* Characters and criteria for selection
A major objective of selection is to improve annual numerical productivity per doe. This global character depends on the breeder, the animal and the environment. The breeder establishes the theoretical reproduction rate of the does. For backyard rabbitries, it is assumed that weaning takes place at 42 days, servicing at 24 days after kindling, and the average conception rate is 70 percent. This gives an average of 6 litters per doe per year.
A culled doe is immediately replaced by a young doe ready for mating. If the stock renewal rate is 100 percent per year, the annual number of litters per doe will be roughly 5.5. If an average 6 young per litter are weaned and 5.5 reach slaughter or reproduction age, the objective is then 30 rabbits per doe annually.
This modest goal is realistic for backyard rabbitries not based exclusively on pelleted feed. If necessary the weaning age can be extended by delaying presentation of the doe for servicing beyond day 24. The theoretical reproduction rate can be stepped up if the goal is too easily achieved or too modest in terms of the potential of the stock and environment. The doe could be brought for servicing at day 17 after kindling with weaning at 35 or 42 days. This would give an additional litter per doe, raising the annual goal to 35 rabbits per doe. A more intensive breeding objective could produce 40-50. For many countries, however, this would not be a realistic goal.
Whatever reproduction rate is adopted, it is important to have fertile does which accept the buck and can produce many large litters with good kindling-to-weaning survival rates. This implies a whole range of characters: acceptance of the buck, gestation, fertility, viability of young, milk production and longevity. These characters and performances can be summed up by the selection criterion: average number of weaned per litter from the first 3 litters obtained within a predetermined period. There is a close correlation between performance during the first 3 litters and the doe's total output. In practice, the following principle could be followed:
* after the second litter, calculate the selection index of the doe based on the average young weaned per litter;
* divide this index by the number of days between the first kindling and the nth kindling (for index for n litters). This gives an index of numerical productivity;
* compare does with the same number of litters against this index.
As weaning age is variable, the number of rabbits weaned can be calculated on litter size at 28 days so the doe's genetic value can be estimated more rapidly.
Chapter 9 describes an even simpler system of choosing breeding stock. which can he done directly in the rabbitry.
The other group of characters for selection have to do with weight gain. One selection criterion is average daily weight gain from weaning to slaughter age, say at day 70. The difference between individual weight at day 70 and individual weight at weaning is divided by the number of days elapsed between these 2 dates. The idea is to speed up post weaning growth. There is no need to measure the quantity of feed consumed, except for experimental purposes or to compare genetic types for selection for feed utilization.
It is not easy to measure the quantity of feed or dry matter eaten by the animals. and when they are given different feeds and local forage feed conversion efficiency is difficult to calculate. Speeding up post weaning growth indirectly reduces the amount of dry matter needed for every kg of liveweight gain.
Slaughter yield, carcass quality (meat/bone ratio, fat) and organoleptic qualities of meat arc complex characters to select for because they can only be measured in carefully controlled slaughter conditions. Direct intrapopulation selection for these characters would he unrealistic. Breeders can check sample figures for these characters for the population they arc using and if improvement is necessary crosses can be made with trucks from good meat breeds (described earlier in this chapter).
* Performance control and technical data management
With stock being used for selection it is necessary to:
* identify each breeding animal individually;
* measure the breeding characters needed for genetic and breeding management of the stock;
* record these characters for later exploitation.
All rabbits are identified at weaning when separated from the dam by a numbered ear tag or a number tattooed in the ear. This might be the date of birth plus a day-of-year identity number. Depending on the size of the group an individual number might have 4 or 5 digits (up to 999 or 9 999 births a year) or even 6 if necessary. Another number indicating genetic type (breed or cross) could be added to the animal's cage card. The following characters should be measured:
On doe and litter cards:
* servicing dates (day, month and year, or numbered day of the year);
* identification number of servicing buck;
* result of pregnancy test by abdominal palpation;
* kindling date and litter: parity of doe, number of live and stillborn young (found living or dead at first examination of nest after kindling);
* weaning dates, number weaned per litter, weaned litter weight and perhaps individual weight at weaning;
* number of rabbits from same litter at day 70, and perhaps individual weight at day 70.
These data are recorded on a doe card, listing each service and litter. Where individual weights are recorded (needed in selection for growth rate) another doe-litter card will be filled out for each litter.
On buck cards.
* date of servicing, number of does serviced, outcome of abdominal palpation, number of live and stillborn young.
This card will show the number of gestations and prolificacy of does serviced by each buck.
On genealogical cards.
The number of the breeding animal (buck or doe) and the numbers of its sire and dam. These cards will make up the genealogical records.
Four kinds of card can be used for the management of the stock. The number of the breeding animal's cage can be marked on the doe, buck and litter cards for more effective follow-up. These cards are designed for manual or computer processing and for setting up data banks. The cards are used as monthly breeding balance sheets and in selection.
* Choosing a selection system
Having defined the selection objectives, the choice of a method is based on:
* the characters to be selected for;
* the genetic progress expected per unit of time;
* the servicing timetable planned for selected breeding stock.
Selection is made by truncation: in keeping for reproduction the animals with the best additive genetic values (or selection index). The genetic progress expected per unit of time is expressed as:
where t is the generation interval and i is selection intensity. This is the selection differential expressed as standard deviation. The selection differential over the index is the difference between average index values in the selected group and in the population before selection. In a normal distribution, i is expressed as a function of the selected percentage p by
where Z is the ordinate of the normal curve reduced to the truncation point. Numerical tables give values of i for different values of p.
s[G] is the additive genetic standard deviation of the character selected, which is a datum of the population.
Two selection methods for increasing litter size can be compared. The most practical method is mass selection in which does are chosen by an index based on performance. The progeny of these does will produce the bucks and does for herd renewal. The important criteria are numbers born alive and weaned per kindling.
Allowing for the weak heritability of this character, selection should be based on the average of k successive kindlings for each doe. starting with k = 3. The rate of selection can be p = 25 percent for the dams of daughters kept for breeding. An average of 4 daughters are kept from each doe selected. The p might be 10 percent for dams of sons kept for breeding. This means one male offspring from each doe selected is kept. At this rate a generation interval of 10-12 months is practicable.
The index value of an individual animal varies with the number k of litters checked; as k increases the figure becomes more exact. The servicing acceptance of the does and their gestation rates must also be considered, selecting on the basis of an index which takes account of the interval of time E DG between the first and k kindling.
The index is more exact when the group is depicted as families of females. showing the performance of the doe, her full sisters and her paternal half sisters. A more complete index will include repeated performances over successive litters of the doe, her full and half sisters and her dam. The selection index is the multiple linear regression equation of additive genetic value to he estimated on the basis of predictive phenotypes.
At INRA's Animal Genetic Improvement Station in Toulouse a combined selection index is used based on the number of rabbits weaned per litter. The predictive phenotypes are the litter sizes of the doe proposed for selection and of her contemporary sisters and dam. The genetic progress expected from selection on the number weaned per litter assumes that certain parameters of the selected population are known (Table 43).
In these conditions the genetic progress E (DG) expected in litter size from one generation to the next is:
* with mass selection based on the average performance in the first 3 litters, E (DG) = 0. 15;
* with combined selection based on average performance in the first 3 litters of the doe and of 3 full sisters, E (DG) = 0.19.
It may he concluded that mass selection that takes into account repeated performances of the does can significantly improve the number of young rabbits weaned per doe ( + 1.5 young over 10 generations). The method is recommended to small-scale breeders.
In theory, progress by mass selection on post-weaning growth rate is swifter than progress on litter size, because the character is more heritable and can be measured in troth sexes. Young males and females can both he selected. Does can he selected on the basis of litter size index and the progeny of these does selected on the basis of post-weaning growth rate. This requires individual weighing of the young and is more difficult to carry out in practice than is selection based on litter size. Only specialized rabbitries can engage in this kind of selection. The breeder who renews his herd on the basis of the best does by litter size and fertility can make a second choice of which young to keep based on their health and weight at a given age.

* Renewal of purebred stock and mating programmes
Here there are different cases to consider: ( 1 ) a rabbitry practicing combined selection based on litter size: (2) mass selection based on the same character for a sizeable number of breeding does in the strain (200); (3) smaller groups.
Case 1: Selection of a strain on the basis of litter size at weaning (INRA, Toulouse). Combined selection, separate generations.
The theoretical plan calls for raising the stock in separate breeding groups, each group constituting a generation. In each generation 196 does are bred with a batch of 42 males. Twenty-five percent of these does are selected according to the results of the first 3 litters, the theoretical reproduction rate permitting a generation interval of 10 months. Each doe selected produces an average of 4 replacement female offspring, so the group is made up of families of full sisters and paternal half sisters.
TABLE 44.-FORMATION OF REPRODUCTION GROUPS BASED ON FAMILY ORIGIN
The mating programme is implemented in accordance with the composition of the breeding groups. Table 44 shows that the females of each of the 14 families are distributed among 14 breeding groups with 3 males ( 1 and 2 alternates) and 14 females. One breeding female is chosen at random per family from among the 196 does.
This mating programme means the genetic value of each doe can be figured according to her performance and those of related females (family average). The plan can also be implemented with fewer than 14 families and 14 breeding groups (eg, 10, or a total of 100 breeding females). The breeding groups system offers the practical advantage of matching a production layout in which families are represented by mother cages. Here, the 14 females' cages and the 3 males' cages are arranged side by side in rows in the rabbitry.
Case 2: Selection of a strain for litter size at weaning at the Irapuato National Rabbit Breeding Centre in Mexico. Mass selection, overlapping generations.
The first system (case 1) using separate generations can be recommended for assessing genetic progress and compiling more exact selection indices, the animals compared being contemporaries. In small rabbitries the numerical productivity of the does is lower and a simultaneous large number of female offspring (future breeders) cannot be supplied by the does selected. In this case the best does supply female offspring for stock renewal over a phased period. The first system, which uses separate breeding groups, does offer the advantage of a sanitary strip between each group and good conditions for experimental studies, but does not make the best use of the mother-cages which are not fully occupied.
For these reasons the Irapuato centre adopted a management system using 15 breeding groups and 15 families with overlapping generations and mass selection. The advantage of this system is that it is easy for breeders to use and does not demand computer processing. The criterion is the number of rabbits weaned per doe and per month of production. Chapter 9 gives a practical guide for stock renewal.
Case 3: Selection in smaller groups.
The breeding groups system can be used with low stock numbers. If there is little or no introduction of outside breeding animals the groups are made up of 2 males and 4-5 females. The families then consist of the young breeding stock produced by these groups. For renewal the young females from one group are distributed among the other groups. The breeding bucks from one group are renewed by does and their progeny selected from their own group. Mother-son matings are avoided in overlapping generations and brother-sister matings in separate generations.
Rouvier (INRA, Toulouse) selected a strain of 60 and then 40 breeding does over 10 generations, using separate generations. At the Irapuato centre in Mexico good meat strains are selected in smaller groups than strains selected for maternal performance, and this is the method used.
Once the breeding animals for herd renewal have been chosen' a mating programme is the next step. Selection may be random, but mating between close relatives such as full brothers-sisters, half-brothers-half-sisters, mother-son or father-daughter must be avoided. In organizing a servicing calendar a practical method is to assign breeding animals to cages according to breeding groups, taking family origin into account. The family is the original breeding group. A breeding group consists of 2-3 cages of sires and l 0-14 cages of dams, or proportionately fewer if the colony is numerically small.
CROSSBREEDING STRATEGIES
Crossbreeding to take advantage of heterosis and nicking ability requires the selection of several pure populations. The first step is to select local populations and strains derived from imported animals. They are crossbred to test the potential improvement of the local populations.
Another aspect of crossing to be considered is the establishment of synthetic strains.
* Crossbreeding systems
1. Simple or 2-breed crossing. Females of a local population, or breed A. will be crossed with males of breed C to improve the growth and muscular development of young meat rabbits and for a heterotic effect on the numerical productivity of does. Using this system the breeder can cross the pure breed A with part of his stock (perhaps 20 percent) for self-renewal of the female stock. The other females will be terminally crossed with C males. which can be obtained from another breeder. All the progeny of this cross are destined for the butcher.
2. Two-stage or 3-breed crossing. Breeding animals of 2 populations (A and B) will be crossed to get an AB crossed female for terminal crossing with males of breed C. The first crossing might be between B males of a good breed for size. fertility and maternal performance with females of a local A population. Using this system the breeder must rely on breeders or multipliers for female AB breeding animals and C sires which demands careful timing and organization.
The system can be elaborated by the use of C sires which have themselves been crossed according to a system widely used in poultry breeding.
3. Rotating and alternative crossbreeding. Using several breeds and local populations for improvement, such as A . B and C, the breeder can apply the following system:
Rotating and alternative crossbreeding.
The advantage of this system is that it offers both heterosis and nicking ability, and the breeder can himself produce his female replacement stock; only the male breeding animals need to he acquired elsewhere. When this system is used with only 2 breeds it is called alternative crossbreeding.
Systems 1 and 3, in which the breeder acquires male breeding animals for stock improvement but can select females from his own rabbitry, are well adapted to small-scale production.
* Synthetic strains
The A B crossing produces an F. generation, which is crossed F. x F. to produce F2, followed by F. and so on. A synthetic strain can thus be constituted which enjoys the nicking ability of the two A and B populations and half the initial heterosis. A synthetic strain can also be established from more than 2 breeds. This system is recommended for improving local populations.
ORGANIZING GENETIC IMPROVEMENT SELECTION PLANS
Genetic improvement and the implementation of selection plans should be worked out at a regional or national level. Questions of genetic progress and its extension to breeders, and of scientific technical training, should be studied at these levels.
The genetic improvement plan for rabbits in France, for instance, covers the following aspects:
* conservation of pure breeds and local endangered populations;
* selection of pure breeds by pure breed producers' associations;
* study of the selection pattern of specialized paternal and maternal lines intended for crossbreeding (Figure 17);
* technical management of commercial-scale rabbitries to bring out the characters governing productivity in does. This involves checking the individual does in on-farm production units by their monthly breeding data, so the best breeding females can be chosen to produce replacement females and males, and the poorest breeders culled. These data also keep the producer himself informed on progress in the rabbitry;
* technical and economic management of production units in terms of overall stock performance.
Guidelines and technical training in selection for collective action (performance checks, establishment of a database and computer processing of data, testing of strains, etc) come under the Livestock Division of the Ministry of Agriculture.
The back-up research and development programme for scientific and technical support and the study of production economics is conducted by INRA and ITAVI (Institut technique de l'aviculture et des animaux de basse-cour) working with producers' associations. These associations are assigned one technician for every 5 000 breeding does. ITAVI and l'Enseignement agricole hold training courses for rabbit breeders and experts.
A country wishing to develop backyard rabbitries could begin by:
1. Setting up a system to record technical and economic data in private rabbitries-production costs, sale prices, climate, local natural resources, consumer patterns, handcrafts (utilization of skins), motivation of breeders for raising rabbits.
2. For experimental purposes, making an analysis of breeding techniques, feeding, specific and nonspecific diseases, and a study of breeding behaviour of local populations and imported breeds.
3. Setting up a system to train breeders and provide them with technical back-up through trained extension agents.
Conclusions
Domestic rabbits are not as widespread as the other species of domestic mammals that are traditionally used to provide meat, milk, wool and skins. But rabbits are genetically very flexible, which makes them adaptable and productive in a wide range of production systems.

Research on rabbit breeding behaviour and production development started only recently-less than 20 years ago-though formal genetic research has a longer history. For production and selection this can be both an advantage and a drawback. The advantage is that there is less temptation for countries to import ready-made solutions without examining their own specific problems. Genetic variability is also equal to the challenge. A relative drawback is that the newness of this field of research makes it necessary to establish the appropriate genetic improvement pattern for each region or country. The major constraint here is dependence on the environment, and a careful study of the production environment is essential.
The great genetic flexibility of the species and its short life cycle are definite assets. This flexibility is a function of a genetic variability which can be traced to the recent domestication of the rabbit and the lack of intensive artificial selection. This has made possible the rapid emergence of breeds varying greatly in adult size and muscle development (adult weight varies at a ratio of 1 to 8). Doe prolificacy depends basically on the breed. In breeds of comparable mature size, average prolificacy is relatively independent of the environment. This character can be turned to good account in deciding how to use local populations.
Various breeds and populations are available for developing or modernizing production. A minimum of environmental factors must be mastered first; for the rest the rabbit will simply adjust to the physical and human constraints of its habitat.
In most developing countries, highly intensive production with complete control over technical and environmental detail is precisely the opposite of what is needed. What is needed are careful country profiles of the production environment (technical studies of local feed resources and genetic and sociological studies) and training for rabbit breeders. For genetic improvement, the first step could be a study of the breeding performance of pure and crossed local populations. Local populations are usually smaller in size and less prolific and appropriate crosses with local and imported breeds for better productivity could be worked out. Existing local populations should always be conserved and selected on an intrapopulation basis so they can be used to improve production in their own environment.

Conclusions
It would be inappropriate here to insert a treatise on rabbit diseases. A disease cannot be described without reference to medical data with which the user of this book in all likelihood is not familiar. In addition, the pathogenic agents of many rabbit diseases are known and in some cases well described their presence does not necessarily imply the existence of a disease. Disease is almost always the result of poor surroundings and environment coupled with the onslaught of a pathogenic agent-microbe, virus or parasite.
This chapter therefore starts with a general discussion of the pathology of the rabbit before it goes into more detailed descriptions of the principal diseases.

<section>c</section>
Appearance and development of diseases
The animal has multiple and interlinking defences for countering attacks from the outside environment. These can be classed arbitrarily and briefly as:
* nonspecific defences which can be mobilized very rapidly or even instantly (such as adrenalin discharge), and which bring into play all the major body metabolisms (mobilization of sugars and fats), and all the major functions (blood circulation, breathing, etc);
* specific defences including immunity which is how the organism recognizes a hostile foreign body (microbe, parasite, virus, protein) and sometimes, though not always, eliminates it.
The body does not have an infinite capacity for nonspecific or specific defence. So the producer's main job is to keep the animal in conditions where it does not have to engage in a permanent struggle for survival.
When it does, the physiologically exhausted animal eventually can no longer defend itself and disease will break out-which disease will depend on the climate, the environment and the type of rabbitry. Not all animal species are equally sensitive to the same kinds of attack. The major known environmental conditions unfavourable to rabbit health are described later in this chapter.
ENVIRONMENT
The environment is everything that surrounds the animal: its habitat, its congeners, its solid and liquid feed, microbial infection, temperature, air, noise. The concept of environment can be extended to the farm, village, region, and even the country. How far the environment extends is no longer an abstract concept when the number of animals per square metre, hectare or square kilometre grows without a parallel upgrading of hygiene and health standards. An infinity of examples for every species of plant and animal show that the larger a population grows, the more it becomes imperative that rules of hygiene be respected.
A point that agricultural officials have all too often seen fit to ignore is that this basic notion is as true at the production-unit level as it is at the village, region or country level. In traditional French rabbitries, for example, pasteurellosis was once a lethal respiratory disease that could decimate the rabbit population of a whole village within a few weeks. Today, the drop in numbers of these traditional units has led to a marked reduction in the epizootic and lethal properties of this disease.
Myxomatosis decimated the rabbit population in western Europe in a few months, not only because the virus had been introduced but mainly because the environment as a whole was favourable, the main factor was the overpopulation of wild and domestic rabbits in France at that time.
As another example, an increase in the number of large rabbitries combined with expanded trading in France, Spain and Italy fostered the appearance and simultaneous spread throughout these 3 countries of a hitherto sporadic disease-dermatomycosis.
MICROBIAL INFECTIONS
Microflora is also a component of the environment. This chapter devotes special attention to microbial infections because they arc a major, inevitable form of attack in all rabbitries.
Microbial infection refers to the polluting of air, objects and soil by bacteria, parasites, viruses or fungi. Most often, these microscopic flora or fauna are not intrinsically pathogenic. They become pathogenic when pollution reaches a high, continuous threshold. Ambient microflora is present from the start of production in a unit and inevitably expands as time goes by. One of the breeder's basic tasks is to slow this inevitable increase as much as possible. This he will do by respecting the rules of hygiene (discussed later) and by limiting stock to the number of animals he can maintain and nourish properly. A small, properly run rabbitry is more productive in the long term than a large one that is poorly run. It is also less of a menace to neighbouring rabbitries.
No matter how capable a breeder is, the day will arrive when his rabbitry will have to be cleared, thoroughly cleaned and disinfected in order to lower ambient microbial infection to a safe level. Farmers everywhere know how important and beneficial fallow periods and crop rotation are for the soil they till. One reason these methods are so beneficial is that they cut down on the local microbial infections specific to each crop. Plant species, like animal species, are each surrounded by their own microbial environment.
The producer's best ally in keeping his rabbits healthy is the animals' own capacity to defend themselves from disease. An organism's defense against outside attacks is basically a global, nonspecific response which is fundamentally dependent on good hygiene standards in the rabbitry. The rules of hygiene are easier to apply and respect in small rabbitries with simple, easy to maintain equipment. Daily preventive cleaning will keep the infection and pollution level down and make the rabbitry viable and productive for a longer period. Preventive hygiene is the key to a clean, well-run rabbitry in which the producer can more effectively control any disease which might break out.
This chapter will deal with disease not as a function of the pathogenic agents specific to the rabbit hut as a function of syndromes or combinations of disease manifestations which share common or closely related symptoms, and which are important in economic terms.
Intestinal diseases
Unquestionably this is the disease order most costly to rabbit breeders and the major obstacle to expanded rabbit production.
Diarrhoea is a serious economic threat primarily in young weaned rabbits (4-10 weeks). It is rare before weaning and can in any case easily he prevented by elementary sanitary and feeding hygiene. It should be noted that diarrhoea appears later in young rabbits than in other young domestic mammals such as piglets, calves, lambs or even young hares. Among these species diarrhoea strikes in the very first days after birth. The fact that young rabbits do not suffer from neonatal diarrhoea is probably due to their being born hairless and blind, and thus confined for weeks to their nests. sheltered from outside attacks.
Diarrhoea is also rare among adult rabbits. It is usually the final consequence of some other ailment.
The first point to make clear is that the rabbit's reaction to disease, whatever the nature of the attack, takes the form of intestinal disturbance, which nearly always expresses itself as diarrhoea. This response can be traced to several features peculiar to the rabbit.
The first has to do with a rabbit's mental reactions. The rabbit is an excitable animal. Its relatively recent domestication has undoubtedly not yet conditioned it to adjust its alarm reactions (discharge of adrenalin) according to the gravity of the attack.
The second peculiarity is the complexity of the rabbit's intestinal physiology. Caecotrophy is one manifestation of this. The hormone reactions governing the alarm reaction directly affect the nervous system of the intestine, halting or slowing peristalsis, which slow the passage of food through the intestine and halt caecotrophy.
A third feature of the rabbit's post-attack reactions is the alkalinization of the contents of the caecum. The increased pH is linked with the slowed passage of food which modifies the intestinal environment, particularly the flora. Escherichia coli, usually few in the healthy rabbit, become dominant. The fact that the soft pellets are no longer ingested also helps to modify the intestinal milieu, particularly the volatile fatty acid balance.
The last peculiar feature of the rabbit is that the appearance of clinical symptoms is delayed after an attack. In animal species that seem to be very excitable (pigs, horses, men) the symptoms appear most often within a few hours (ulcer, colic, diarrhoea). In the rabbit an ordinary change of habitat, a scare or a journey have no immediate consequences. Diarrhoea appears only some 5-7 days afterwards.
GENERAL SYMPTOMS OF DIGESTIVE' PROBLEMS
The symptomatology of rabbit enteritis is relatively simple and constant and rarely permits an etiological diagnosis of the disease. The first signs, scarcely noticed by the breeder, last 1-3 days, and take the form of a decrease in feed intake (especially solid feed) and growth. Next, diarrhoea appears, sometimes preceded by complete constipation or production of soft pellets which are not eaten.
Diarrhoea is moderate, consisting of a small quantity of fairly liquid faeces which soil the animal's hindquarters. Death can occur at this stage, sometimes even before the appearance of diarrhoea. Skin dehydration also appears at this time.
Two or three days later the acute phase of the illness starts. It involves an almost total stop in troth solid and liquid intake, extensive diarrhoea and high mortality; grinding of the teeth is a symptom of severe intestinal pain. Death follows after several hours of agitated coma with spasmodic twitching. If the animal survives a full day in coma it may recover fully within a few days.
Recovery is in fact remarkably swift. Diarrhoea often gives way to constipation. The pellets are small, hard and malformed. In a rabbit 2-3 months old, the constipation phase is often the only symptom. Physiologically, however, diarrhoea will have occurred and can be perceived by palpating the abdomen: during the acute phase the breeder can feel that the caecum content is liquid.
A post-mortem examination shows Iesions, usually atypical. During the acute phase the intestinal content is very liquid, sometimes discolored. The caecum often fills with gas and contains little food matter.
The intestine is sometimes congested or bruised. The walls of the caecum are most striking, congested and streaked with red, like brushstrokes. The colon may be filled with a translucent jelly. There will usually be no fibrin in the abdominal cavity, an indication of the acute stage of this disease.
CAUSES
There are many causes of diarrhoea. Specific and nonspecific causes should be distinguished.
* Nonspecific causes
It has been seen that very different kinds of attack can cause outbreaks of diarrhoea. Rabbits seem to react negatively to: transport, especially during the post-weaning period; being put in a new hutch or cage; the presence of unusual visitors (people or animals); unusual sounds not identifiable by the animal, lasting for hours or days, such as work in progress near the rabbitry.
Feeding is unquestionably a prime factor in the occurrence of diarrhoea. Not enough crude fibre, too much protein, and meal which has been too finely ground are all unfavourable.
Feed changes are all too often blamed for diarrhoea. Even when feed is the obvious cause, more often the problem is the composition of the feed rather than the change itself. On the other hand, when the animals do not always have good feed available, at least the daily timetable of feed distribution should be respected. There have been many instances of diarrhoea "epidemics" in rabbitries where a change in timetable was the suspected culprit. This is easily explained by the rabbit's complex intestinal physiology (caecotrophy).
Improper watering is very common in farm rabbitries. It is probably one of the major causes of mucoid enteritis. Rabbits must have clean water available at all times.
It can bear repeating here that the nonspecific causes favouring the appearance of diarrhoea can be defined as anything which forces the animal to spend too much time defending itself against its surroundings.
* Specific causes
Theoretically, these include any cause which, alone, allows the disease to multiply. In fact, the state of health is almost always the main factor.
Chemical agents. Various antibiotics invariably provoke diarrhoea: ampicillin, Iyncomycin and clyndamycin. Antibiotics should always be used very sparingly with rabbits, especially penicillin.
It seems that drinking water with a high nitrate count causes the chronic diarrhoea noted in some areas.
Mouldy feed (pellets, domestic waste, bread, vegetable peels) can very quickly give even a healthy rabbit diarrhoea.
Viruses and bacteria. There is little work on enteropathogenic rabbit viruses but they are known to exist. It is very likely, however, that as with most other animal species the condition of the animal itself is a decisive factor in the outbreak of viral diarrhoea.
Much the same is true of bacteria. Salmonella bacteria are rarely isolated in sick rabbits, but this is not true of Corynebacteria, Clostridia, Pasteurella and, especially, Escherichia coli. Apart from some Clostridia and a few serotypes of E. coli, healthy rabbits carrying these bacteria do not contract the relevant disease. Nevertheless they must be regarded as specific pathogenic agents even if they express their pathogenicity only in an aleatory manner. For example:
* the most pathogenic among them (Clostridium, certain serotypes of E. coli) can, above a certain pollution threshold in the rabbitry, be the direct cause of diarrhoea and its persistence;
* very often, if not always, they constitute a secondary complication of a type of enteritis which is not serious at the start but does become serious and then lethal;
* with both Clostridium and E. coli, pathogenicity depends in part on toxins which rapidly provoke irreversible lesions.
Intestinal parasites. All the major parasite families are found in rabbits: trematodes (flukes), cestodes (tapeworms), nematodes (intestinal
worms) and protozoa (coccidia). Coccidia are the major specific agents of diarrhoea in the rabbit. In view of their importance the following section is concerned solely with them. The other parasitic diseases will be dealt with as a whole after coccidiosis and bacterial enteritis.
COCCIDIA AND COCCIDIOS
* Coccidia
Coccidia are protozoa, the most primitive phylum of the animal kingdom. They are sporozoa, ie, parasites with no cilia and no flagella, which reproduce both sexually and asexually. A large number of families are represented. The Eimeriidae family is typified by the independent development of male and female gametes.
Almost all Coccidia belong to the genus Eimeria-they include 4 sporocysts containing 2 sporozoites. Typically they form oocysts, a parasite mechanism for dispersal and defence in an external environment.
The Coccidia cycle. Eimeria are monoxenous and have very high host specificity. The rabbit therefore cannot be infested by the Coccidia of other animal species, nor they by rabbit coccidia. Eimeria develop in the epithelial cells of the digestive apparatus (intestine, liver). Eggs (oocysts) are found in the intestine and faeces. After maturing (sporulation), the oocysts contain 8 "embryos" (sporozoites).
The Eimeria cycle includes 2 distinct phases:
* an internal phase (schizogony + gamogony) in which the parasite multiplies and the oocysts are eliminated in the faeces;
* an external phase (sporogony) during which the oocyst becomes able to infest if it finds favourable conditions of humidity, heat and oxygenation.
The internal part of the cycle begins with ingestion of the sporulated oocyst and the exit of the sporozoites. The parasite then multiplies. This may entail 1, 2 or more schizogonies (asexual reproduction) according to the species (E. media, 2 schizogonies; E. irresidua, 3 or 4 schizogonies). It can take place in different parts of the digestive apparatus (E. stiedal in the liver, E. magna in the small intestine, E. flavescens in the caecum). The final schizogony leads to the formation of gametes.
The next step, gamogony (sexual reproduction), ends in the formation of oocysts that are excreted with the faeces into the outside environment. The total duration of the internal phase of the cycle also varies with the species (eg, E. stiedai, 14 days; E. perforans, 4 days).
The external part of the cycle (sporogony) is typified by the extraordinary resistance of the oocysts to the outside environment. Their resistance to chemical agents is particularly striking. In the right conditions of humidity, heat and oxygenation the oocysts become able to infest. They sporulate. Hatching time varies: at 26°C, E. stiedai takes 3 days and E. perforans 1 day.
Numerous studies, especially those of Coudert (1981) in France, have dealt with this part of the cycle, as the oocyst is the contaminant to be destroyed. In practice, oocyst resistance is hard to overcome, particularly in disinfecting rabbitries. Chemical disinfection is pointless as oocysts can only be destroyed by heating and drying.
Species. At least 9 coccidia species are rabbit parasites. One infests the liver, the other 8 the intestine.
Eimeria stiedai, the liver coccidiosis, causes no economic losses in Europe except at the slaughterhouse. It is relatively easy to eliminate this parasitosis by a few weeks of very strict health and hygiene measures and preventive medicine. A 4-6 week treatment with conventional anticoccidia products (Decox, Pancoxin, formosulfathiazole) in the feed at preventive doses virtually eliminates the disease.
In climates less clement than Europe's and in countries where it is not so easy to get the right medicines, liver coccidiosis can have more serious consequences. As the liver is an organ basic to every process involving homeostasis, chronic liver attacks cannot fail to diminish the animal's resistance capacity.
Intestinal coccidia can be classified in 4 categories (Table 45).
E. coecicola is apathogenic. No clinical sign is detectable even in an inoculum containing several million oocysts.
E. perforans and E. media are very slightly or slightly pathogenic. Alone, they never cause diarrhoea or mortality. Massive infestations ( 106 oocysts) are needed before there is a slight and very brief decrease in growth.
E. irresidua, E. magna and E. piriformis are pathogenic species that cause extensive diarrhoea and retarded growth-as much as 15-20 percent of liveweight-for infestations between 0.5 and 1 x 10^5 oocysts. When they occur alone these coccidia are not usually lethal, even in a relatively heavy infestation.
E. intestinalis and E. flavescens are the most pathogenic coccidia. They cause diarrhoea and mortality, even at very low concentrations (upwards of 10^3 oocysts).

Pathogenic effect has been judged here solely on the basis of retarded growth and mortality. But it must not be forgotten that coccidiosis, like all diseases. can have certain after-effects, on the kidneys or liver in particular, which in turn have repercussions on fattening status at slaughter, or on the animal's future if it is to be kept as a breeding animal.
Often a disease is also complicated by other diseases. In fact, the above results were obtained with rabbits reared under especially favourable conditions, which means there were practically no bacterial side infections. It is not known, for example, whether coccidia of the second group (E. media, etc) might not in an unfavourable environment have a more severe impact.
Lesions. There are two kinds of lesions: macroscopic and histologic. Both are relatively short-lived. They appear towards the 8th or 9th day and disappear by the 12th or 13th day, despite their sometimes spectacular appearance.
Macroscopic: Every coccidium has a preferential place to develop where it causes a reaction of the intestinal epithelium varying in visibility according to the bacterial species.
The duodenum and the jejunum are parasitized by E. perforans, E. media and E. irresidua. The latter species is the only one which causes macroscopic lesions visible in an autopsy at high concentrations.
E. magna and E. intestinalis multiply in the ileum. E. intestinalis causes the most spectacular macroscopic lesions. The ileum becomes bruised and whitens; segmentation appears very clearly, especially in the part nearest the caecum. The lesional appearance is the same with high concentrations of E. magna.
The caecum is the domain of E. flavescens, which at medium concentrations produces lesions on the colon. The caecum wall thickens and changes appearance according to whether there is microbial side infection or not. It may look whitish in heavy infestations with no complications, but very frequently reddish striations, necrotic plaques or generalized congestion appear. The most constant factor is the emptiness of the caecum.
Lesions can be caused in the colon by E. flavescens and above all by E. piriformis, the only rabbit coccidium capable of causing enterorrhagia in the Fusus cold at medium concentrations (30 000 to 50 000 oocysts).
Histology: Hystologically, hypertrophy can only be observed in the epithelial cells of the intestine. Cell structure remains intact. Moreover, the number of cells parasitized is extremely low in proportion to the number of cells of the epithelium, but all the cells, whether parasitized or not. look the same. Only a few cell clusters deep in the crypts of Lieberkuhn will be destroyed.
* Coccidiosis
Coccidia are specific pathogenic agents. When inoculated into rabbits pathogenic coccidia cause the same lesions and the same symptoms (diarrhoea, loss of weight, death) in all the animals tested.
Clinical signs. Most of these are not specific to intestinal coccidiosis. The main symptoms are:
* diarrhoea;
* weight loss;
* low intake of feed and water;
* contagion;
* death.
The clinical evolution of an intestinal coccidiosis is illustrated in Figure 18.
Depending on the coccidia species, diarrhoea appears between the 4th and the 6th day after infestation. The peak is from the 8th to the 10th day. It then declines in 3 or 4 days. Diarrhoea is the first visible symptom, together with cutaneous dehydration, clinically demonstrated by the persistence of skin folds.
Weight gain and feed intake evolve in a sequence that faithfully follows the evolution of the diarrhoea. For 2 or 3 days growth and feed intake are low. Between the 7th and 10th day after infestation there is weight loss, perhaps as much as 20 percent of liveweight in 2 or 3 days. Recovery is equally rapid. Two weeks after inoculation the animals may resume their initial growth.
Mortality rages for a relatively short period (3-4 days). It starts abruptly on the 9th day after infestation.
The intensity of these general symptoms naturally varies according to the Eimeria species involved (see above), the degree of infestation and the animal's general condition. Identical effects can be obtained by using different concentrations of different species of Eimeria.
Few data are available on simultaneous infestations, but there appears to be no synergistic action among the various species except with E. piriformis which seems to augment considerably the pathogenicity of other species. This is rather easily explained by its locus of implantation and the fundamental role of the colon (see physiopathology, below).
It is common for bacterial flora to develop at the same time as coccidiosis, complicating and aggravating the symptoms of the disease.
FIGURE 18.-The clinical evolution of coccidiosis
Rabbit age is not a major factor in susceptibility to coccidia. The disease is briefer in animals 10-11 weeks old and diarrhoea less severe, but weight loss and mortality are often more extensive than in younger rabbits.
Physiopathology of diarrhoea of coccidian origin. The main symptom of intestinal disease in young rabbits is diarrhoea.
Rabbit enteritis following coccidiosis has been studied with reference to calves and human infants, in whom episodes of diarrhoea are essentially linked with hydromineral perturbations. In calves and infants diarrhoea seems to be dominated by 3 main phenomena. There is, of course, considerable loss of faecal matter. The usual impact on the metabolism is extracellular dehydration and metabolic acidosis. Rabbits suffering from diarrhoea, like calves and infants, certainly have more watery faeces, but sick animals produce a smaller quantity of faeces than healthy ones. Calves and infants urinate little or not at all with diarrhoea, and there is haemoconcentration associated with extracellular dehydration. In young rabbits, diuresis is not altered during diarrhoea and there is haemodilution. The distribution of water in the organism is unmodified except that the skin is heavily dehydrated. Blood pH is normal. The most marked modification of the blood plasma is severe
hypokalemia.
The pathogenesis of diarrhoea in the young rabbit thus appears to differ from the more conventional diarrhoea of the calf or infant, but the prime mover at the intestinal level seems to be common to all. In the diarrhoea of calves due to E. coli, for example, the small intestine secrete water and minerals, especially sodium, which will be lost by the animal
In the young rabbit there is also a lack of reabsorption-indeed a' actual secretion-of sodium and water in the loci where the parasite multiply. Unlike calves, however' rabbits can compensate for tines' disturbances in the distal colon and, most importantly, they can initiate an Na-K exchange which limits sodium losses to a minimum. Potassium losses are replaced from body reserves.
These different parameters evolve at the same time as the symptoms described earlier. Peak intensity occurs about the 10th day after infestation. Certain elements are generally described as constants in rabbit enteritis: lengthening of the retention time of the ingesta in the intestine, high levels of colibacilli, and intestinal pH tending towards basicity.
This suggests the basic phenomena of the pathogenesis of diarrhoea are independent of the etiology (infectious agents or nonspecific causes) and that the diarrhoea syndrome is a complex process. It may lead to a single response but several elements are involved-digestion, flora, motility, absorption and secretion.
One might likewise be tempted to attribute the sometimes spectacular lesions to the pathogenicity of the coccidia. But this would overlook the fact that these modifications in hydromineral metabolism and pH are delayed manifestations of an attack that took place days before.
* Coccidiosis and field conditions
All production units are parasitized, usually by several species of coccidia. Investigations show that the least pathogenic species are the most numerous (Eimeria perforans, E. media). E. magna is also very common and often found in great numbers. E. intestinalis, E. flavescens and E. irresidua are less common. This is a good thing, because their mere presence is a real menace to the rabbitry. E. piriformis is far rarer, at least in Europe.
It must never be forgotten that a single pellet from a healthy rabbit raised in a sound, clean rabbitry usually contains enough coccidia to cause diarrhoea if the same amount were inoculated into the animal. Yet not all rabbits contract clinical coccidiosis. It almost always depends on conditions in the rabbitry. If conditions are good only a few animals will die of diarrhoea. If conditions are bad there will be a chronic mortality rate of 10-15 percent. Indeed, this is the usual figure.
Whether the environment is good or bad, any attack can set off coccidiosis, whatever the animal's age. It is curious to note that diarrhoea strikes not only young, newly weaned rabbits, but also older animals which have been in contact with the parasites for several weeks. Naturally acquired specific immunity is always very weak.
The outbreak of coccidiosis, the progress of which is summarized in Figure 19, can therefore be attributed mostly to stress.
Nonspecific attacks occurring singly cannot cause diarrhoea in a rabbitry where sanitary standards and physiological comfort are good. In such an environment the animal is able to marshal fully its nonspecific defence potential. On the other hand, a simple change of feed in a rabbitry with a poor environment is enough to set off diarrhoea. The mere fact of raising 56 rabbits together in a cage one third of a square metre in a room with 100 or 1 000 other cages acts as a sort of sounding board to amplify all these phenomena.
Lastly, nonspecific factors cannot be discussed without mentioning their intensity-5 minutes' transport does not constitute the same aggression as 4 hours. These upsets are the root cause of outbreaks and it is only later, in most cases, that specific disease agents intervene (viruses, bacteria, coccidia). Each agent, merely by its permanent presence at low or average concentrations, can also help undermine the organism's defence mechanisms without there necessarily being any permanent clinical disease.
The same is true of the other specific chronic diseases such as respiratory ailments and myxomatosis, which by the very process of sapping the organism's defence capacities will become the indirect agents of outbreaks of coccidiosis and diarrhoea.
Cases of primary coccidiosis are therefore probably rare. They can nevertheless occur, in particular when outside animals which are carriers of pathogenic species are introduced to the rabbitry.
Diagnosis. Coccidiosis is often extremely difficult to diagnose. It can only be done in the laboratory, by counting coccidia per gram of excrement and examining the viscera. Counts must be made on several animals for several days running to diagnose coccidiosis properly. The specific coccidia species and their pathogenic strength also need to be identified.
FIGURE 19.-Development of coccidiosis
For coproscopic investigations, a stool examination of excrete several days old taken from under a cage where there are several animals is preferable to and far more reliable than a caecum content examination. At any given moment (death or slaughter of the animal) there may be:
* no trace of coccidia and coccidiosis: this is the not uncommon case with animals that die before the completion of the coccidial cycle;
* few coccidia and little coccidiosis: as above, with mortality occurring a little later. This happens mainly with very pathogenic coccidia which kill rapidly (E. intestinalis, E. flavescens) even at low concentrations;
* many coccidia and no clinical coccidiosis in the case of infestations with not very pathogenic coccidia (E. coecicola, E. perforans, E. media). The multiplication of the parasite will nonetheless be a negative factor.
Despite these difficulties it can be stated categorically that the sole presence of E. intestinalis, E. flavescens, and even E. irresidua or E. piriformis is a serious circumstance and with the first two a definite menace. A post-mortem examination is often disappointing. The typical coccidiosis lesions appear only with massive infestations and persist for only 2 or 3 days. The presence of whitish spots on the intestine is an indication, but not a proof, of coccidiosis. In any case it is recommended that an autopsy be carried out on all dead animals. A combination of observed factors, even if observed hastily, is far preferable to an isolated finding.
Liver coccidiosis, on the contrary, is very easy to diagnose. The presence of small whitish-yellow patches or small nodules on the surface or inside the liver is typical of this disease. But only massive coccidiosis, which sometimes provokes spectacular liver hypertrophy and considerable weight loss, can account for mortality.
Prognosis. A coccidiosis prognosis will not be of much use unless the expert also diagnoses why there has been an outbreak. All rabbits are coccidia carriers so it cannot be attributed to the parasites alone (they were already present). Conditions in the rabbitry and the animals' resistance being such as to produce a multiplication of Eimeria, the environment must also be examined and treated. This is where the prognosis is often quite bleak.
* Control
This section is always eagerly awaited, because people still hope for miracles. There is no miracle available in coccidiosis control. Treatment is often disappointing and always expensive. There are basically two reasons for this:
-medical treatment is not really appropriate unless the cause of the disease is known. In the rabbit, the disease most often begins through a combination of several nonspecific factors. The environment, then, needs to be dealt with first;
-anticoccidiosis treatment is feasible for animals that have been infected for only a few days (5 or 6), but it is not effective otherwise. Even after successful treatment it should be realized that mortality and diarrhoea will continue in the rabbitry for a few more days. The most disappointing thing is that an improvement lasting 1 or 2 weeks is often followed by a relapse. It must be understood that a few days of diarrhoea in a rabbitry breeds thousands of millions of coccidia, only a few hundred of the most pathogenic of which are enough to kill an individual rabbit.
Sulpha drug treatment. The most common drugs are nitrofurans and sulpha drugs. The former have been used nonstop for nearly 30 years in feed. This may be one reason why present-day coccidia control is so ineffective. Nonetheless, the bacteriostatic activity of these drugs probably favours recovery or avoids problems. Bifuran (50% furazolidane, 50% furoxone) at rates of 200 mg/kg of feed is now used only as a preventive measure.
Sulpha drugs are most effective in treatment, not in prevention. Sulfadimethoxine is the most effective sulpha drug, and the one best tolerated by nursing or pregnant does: curative dose: 0.5 to 0.7 g/litre drinking water preventive dose: 0.25 g/litre drinking water.
The bacteriostatic activity of this drug, especially on pasteurellosis, makes it one of the best rabbit medicines. It should not be overused.
Sulfaquinoxaline is commonly used, but at higher doses: curative dose: 1 g/litre drinking water preventive dose: 0.50 g/litre drinking water.
Sulfadimerazine, at 2 g/litre, is less effective.
These sulpha drugs can be boosted by antifolics such as pyrimethamine or diaveridine, which allows the dose to be reduced considerably, but this increases their toxicity, especially for pregnant does. The use of sulpha drugs for pregnant does must be systematically avoided.
Formosulfathiazole is another excellent coccidiostatic drug at rates of 0.5-0.8 g/kg of feed as a curative measure, or 0.3-0.5 g/kg as a preventive measure. Unfortunately it is not water soluble.
Curative treatments should always be applied to all growing animals for 45 consecutive days followed by a therapeutic rest. Treatment is then resumed for a further 4-5 days. If the medicine is given in the drinking water care must be taken that the water is constantly clear. Where animals are fed watery forage such as roots and greens, these should be replaced by dry feeds or the animals will not drink enough water.
Drug concentrations as generally indicated correspond roughly to a water intake of 100-150 g water per kg of liveweight. When water intake exceeds this normal quantity (nursing does, very hot weather) the drug should be further diluted. Stepping up the concentration is not really possible-the rabbit would then probably refuse to drink the water.
Treatment with antibiotics. Antibiotics do not cure coccidiosis. They may, however, be used in cases of persistent diarrhoea or to prevent secondary bacterial complications. The most common antibiotics used for rabbits are neomycin (0.1-0.4 mg/litre of drinking water), colimycin (34.105 lU/litre) and the tetracycline group (0.2-0.3 g/litre). Once treatment with antibiotics is started it must be continued for 3-4 days at steady doses if it is to have any chance of being effective.
Antibiotics must be used cautiously in treating rabbits. Some that basically act on gram-positive flora are toxic to rabbits (ampicillin, Iyncomycin, clyndamycin), while others should not be administered orally (chloramphenicol, penicillin, erythromycin, tylosin).
With the possible exception of neomycin and the tetracyclines, antibiotics always entail the risk of digestive troubles.
In treating undiagnosed diarrhoea the proper treatment of coccidia alone is often enough to reverse the situation. Many authors stress the importance of intestinal coccidiosis as a factor in the outbreak of enteritis and the benefit of treating coccidia.
It should be remembered that giving medicine is not in itself sufficient treatment.
Prevention. Nonspecific attacks and coccidiosis are the basic causes of diarrhoea. Diarrhoea prevention therefore consists of controlling these two factors. Good hygiene is the proper way to prevent the first. Preventive medicine should be added to combat coccidiosis.
There are two kinds of preventive medicine: vaccination and chemopreventive treatment. There is no anticoccidiosis vaccine and vaccination against intestinal bacterial diseases has proven nearly 100 percent ineffective.
Doses of sulpha drugs (see preceding pages) given to the young rabbits at weaning for 8-10 days are a good preventive measure in problem rabbitries.
Anticoccidial drugs administered as a preventive measure in balanced pelleted feeds are without doubt the most popular control method. A certain number of products can be used for rabbits (Figure 20). Robenidine is today the most effective and best tolerated product. Others, such as Salinomycin and Narasin, are just as effective against coccidia but the conditions under which they should be used have not yet been worked out. Anticoccidial products much in use in poultry husbandry, such as Amprolium and Coyden (methylchlorpindol), have little if any effect on rabbits. Coudert (1981) has made an exhaustive bibliographic review of these products.
The disadvantage of these drugs is that they are not water soluble, which means they can only be administered in balanced pelleted feeds.
Antibiotics added to feed in constant low doses are strongly warned against as ineffective and dangerous.
Preventive hygiene is the keystone of coccidiosis control and successful rabbit production. It is far more important than any other anticoccidiosis measures and for this reason the last section of this chapter deals solely with preventive hygiene.
BACTERIAL ENTERITIS
Apart from coccidiosis there are two other classic types of rabbit diarrhoea. Renault (1975) has published a detailed description of the mechanism of these diseases.
* Mucoid enteritis
A special kind of diarrhoea sometimes affects growing rabbits and nursing does: very soft pellets are mixed with a translucent, gelatinous substance called mucus. Autopsy shows the colon and rectum filled with considerable amounts of this mucus, which somewhat resembles egg white. All sorts of hypotheses have been put forward to explain this type of diarrhoea. It is now universally considered a particular expression of enteritis, which can have many varied causes, bacterial (E. coli. etc) or nutritional (not enough water, and above all not enough roughage).
* Enterotoxaemia, colibacillosis, typhlitis
These various names, like mucoid enteritis, refer in fact to types of enteritis which may have different causes but are very similar clinically and necroscopically. The diseases often develop rapidly (3-4 days). Death can intervene before diarrhoea appears. When developing enzootically in a rabbitry there are phases of mucoid diarrhoea or constipation.

The autopsy shows lesions not very dissimilar from those described for coccidiosis. At most there is more gas in the caecum, which is frequently mottled with red striations. The liver and kidneys sometimes look abnormal (crumbly liver, discoloured kidneys).
The bacteria most often blamed are Clostridia and Escherichia coli.
Clostridia (C. perfringens, C. welchii, C. septicum) are hardly ever isolated in growing rabbits after weaning. Perhaps this is partly because these are anaerobic germs which require a battery of special techniques for their isolation and identification. E. coli, on the other hand, occur systematically in very large numbers in rabbits with diarrhoea or even with coccidiosis. It should be remembered that a healthy rabbit, unlike all other animal species, hosts very few colibacilla (102-103/g faeces). Some authors have isolated nearly 200 different strains in sick rabbits. Fortunately, not all are pathogenic, and the number of serotypes (strains) involved is relatively small.
The enteropathogenicity of these strains comes from toxins they secrete. However, diarrhoea has hardly ever been produced experimentally using these enteropathogenic strains alone. For these E. cold to cause diarrhoea the animal has to undergo some other attack at the same time (unbalanced feeding, coccidia, thermal shock, etc).
While the clinical and necroscopic appearance of these diarrhoeas of nonparasitic origin differs somewhat from that of coccidiosis, the conditions governing their occurrence are the same. First and foremost the field conditions must lend themselves to the spread of the infectious agent (E. cold or coccidia).
Some factors perhaps more specifically favouring this type of diarrhoea are excess protein in the diet (over 18 percent) combined with insufficient roughage (under 10 percent indigestible crude fibre). This enterotoxaemia often associated with coccidiosis is frequently reported from farm rabbitries where the rabbits are fed fresh-cut forage which is strewn on the ground.
Curative treatment is always too late, given the acute nature of this kind of enteritis. Antibiotics and sulpha drugs will prevent the spread of the disease and very often it is enough to replace the feed (pellets or green forage) by some good dry hay to cut losses. But if nothing is changed in the general conditions of the rabbitry, the same problems will soon recur.

OTHER GASTROINTESTINAL PARASITES
Glancing through a book on parasitology the reader soon discovers that several dozen different sorts of parasite can be found in the rabbit's digestive tract. They will not all be dealt with here as most are either very rare or only pathogenic under exceptional circumstances, or are little known or unknown in domestic rabbits. But in the farm rabbitry context, especially in the tropics, it is useful to have a basic grasp of the biological conditions that favour the development of such parasites.
Only one intestinal parasitic disease is found in rational rabbit production in Europe: coccidiosis. Wild rabbits living in the same regions. however, have many other parasites.
The main reason for this has to do with the various parasite cycles. Many are heteroxenous (multihost): to multiply and develop they must live successively on several hosts. For example, the little liver fluke shifts from mammal to snail to ant to mammal.
Others are monoxenous (single host) but the larval or adult form develops only in the outside environment under certain conditions (wet grassland, stagnant water, etc). This explains why rational production, by breaking the life cycle of these parasites, has eliminated the parasitic diseases they cause.
Some of these parasites are still found in farm rabbitries.
* Some intestinal parasites found in farm rabbitries
Cysticercosis (fapeworm). This common parasite produces fine, white streaks on the liver and translucent cysts, alone or in bunches, on the peritoneum and viscera. The cysts are produced by the larvae of dog and cat tapeworms. Rabbits are contaminated by eating feed that has been in contact with excrement. The final hosts (dog, cat, fox) become carriers by eating rabbit viscera.
Symptoms are few-sometimes diarrhoea-except with heavy infestations (not uncommon) when growth rate slows. There is no curative treatment. The other domestic animals have to be treated. Tapeworm larvae of other species of animals (pig, rat, etc) can also infest rabbits.
It is worth mentioning here that the larvae of some dog and cat tapeworms can infest not only rabbits but people as well (echinococcosis, coenurosis). The lesions are cyst clusters forming translucent "tumours" on the viscera or in the brain.
Taeniasis (tapeworm). Half a dozen tapeworm varieties can infest rabbits which become contaminated by eating mites in wet grass. Clinical symptoms are slight: mild diarrhoea, sometimes weight loss, very rarely mortality from intestinal perforation. A necropsy reveals flat worms a few millimetres wide, in lengths varying by species ( I cm to 1 m).
Tapeworms are seldom found in domestic rabbits. Treatments applicable to other animal species may be used.
Fasciola sp. and Dicrocoelium sp. (trematodes). Liver fluke (Fasciola hepatica) and little fluke (Dicrocoelium lanceolatum) are also very rare in rabbits. The conditions of infestation are the same as for ruminants. The intermediate hosts are certain snails found in grass from marshy areas (Fasciola sp.), or other types of snails and ants (Dicrocoelium sp.). Usually the only symptom is slowed growth. Treatment is pointless.
Trichostrongylus (nematodes). These are also small round worms (called roundworms), measuring 4 to 16 mm in length. The Graphidium (stomach worm) is rare in Europe but Trichostrongylus is very common in farm rabbitries. Rabbits become infested by eating green forage contaminated by larvae. The intrinsic pathogenic strength of these parasites is relatively weak, but they do greatly aggravate other rabbit ailments, particularly diarrhoea. Massive infestations can cause extreme inflammation of various parts of the intestinal tract (stomach, small intestine, caecum).
The conventional anthelmintics (thiabendazole, phenothiazine, tetramisole) can be used for rabbits. It is recommended that regular treatments be applied every month or two in contaminated farm rabbitries.
Two other small roundworms are frequently found in rabbit caeca and colons: Passalurus and Trichuris. These do not appear to be pathogenic except with massive infestations.
Strongyloïdes (nematodes). These are small roundworms a few millimetres long able to migrate throughout all organs and reach the intestine. The etiology and epizootiology are identical to those in ruminants and pigs. Some massive infestations have been described in rabbits living in dark, damp, poorly kept hutches.
* Preventive hygiene
Intestinal parasitism is very common in wild rabbits. It is frequent and not of great economic importance in farm-bred domestic rabbits if overall sanitary and health conditions are satisfactory. In poorly kept hutches or where infestation is massive these parasites enhance all other ailments, both intestinal and other, making them acute, enzootic and lethal.
Rational rabbit production has done away with all these intestinal worms. Control is easy; it is only necessary to break the parasite's life cycle. Essentially this means taking care with forage:
* it should not be gathered in areas where there are numbers of dogs, cats or wild rabbits;
* it should be stored out of reach of these animals;
* it should be gathered at midday when the dew is gone (avoiding marshy areas) and not be cut too near the ground. Indeed, many of these parasites avoid dry surroundings and strong light;
* it should be sundried before it is given to rabbits. Drying kills most of the worms and their larvae;
* it should be distributed on feed racks where animals are unable to soil it with their faeces or urine.
Parasitism can be considerably cut back by frequent changing of the straw litter, which should always be dry. Late slaughter of fattening rabbits (3 months or more) is a negative factor, as some parasites have a rather long life cycle. This is interrupted by earlier slaughter. Regular treatment can also include broad spectrum anthelmintics or copper sulphate-based preparations in drinking water ( I percent) for I or 2 days.
Respiratory diseases
Respiratory ailments are common among domestic rabbits. In rational production, they essentially strike breeding adults. In a farm rabbitry young rabbits can also be affected. Where such ailments are endemic, losses are especially to be feared among the females, in which the disease becomes chronic, leading to production stoppages and mortality among the nursing young. Respiratory diseases usually remain endemic, but abrupt epidemics, which can decimate the stock in a few weeks, sometimes break out in farm rabbitries.
CLINICAL FEATURES
The first symptoms arc a clear, fluid nasal discharge and frequent sneezing. The rabbit often rubs its nose with its fore-paws, the fur of which becomes matted and dirty. This is the first stage, common coryza, which is an attack on the upper respiratory tract.
Later the discharge turns yellowish, thick and purulent. Sneezing is less frequent but coughing may begin. Purulent coryza can remain stationary or develop into pneumonia, either spontaneously or from other specific or nonspecific causes (enteritis, lactation, malnutrition, etc). With pneumonia, the coryza, the sneezing and even the coughing and snuffling may disappear. The only symptoms will be slower respiratory movements, clearly visible in the nostrils, and difficulty in breathing in. In young rabbits growth slows or stops. Complications are frequent: diarrhoea, ophthalmia. sinusitis, torticollis (wryneck) and abscesses. Females can die suddenly during lactation or gestation.
At autopsy, coryza is manifested by the presence of pus in the nasal cavities and the atrophy of the mucous membranes. The lungs may be congested and parts may have a liver-like appearance. Very often there are lung abscesses with abundant yellowish-white caseous pus filling most of the chest cavity.
CAUSES
As with diarrhoea respiratory infections are due to the association of nonspecific contributing causes with infectious agents.
All the nonspecific attacks mentioned in the previous sections are decisive for the development of respiratory ailments. The lungs are protected by the rabbit's very developed, very complex nasal cavities. These cavities are covered by the pituitary membrane, which acts as a filter to stop dust and airborne microbes. It is therefore essential to protect this mucous membrane and keep it intact. The pituitary membrane is particularly sensitive to the following:
* abrupt cooling of the air can be the sole cause of common coryza. Such colds may clear up spontaneously and quickly in a healthy environment;
* dust (crumbly granulated feed pollen, dust in the air from dry sweeping, or a nearby dirt road) can cause common coryza through the reflex action of the pituitary membrane. Prognosis as above;
* air flow, humidity and temperature are three very closely linked environmental factors that are instrumental in triggering respiratory ailments. At lower temperatures the air must be correspondingly drier and move more slowly. Rabbits seem to be very sensitive to draughts. Air flow should not exceed 0.30 m/sec unless the humidity is over 75%. Ventilation errors in closed buildings are the chief cause of chronic pneumonia;
* ammonia and gases forming from decomposing, urine-soaked straw litters quickly break down the pituitary membrane and gain direct access to the lungs.
* Infectious agents
Three constants of disease agents are the randomness of their pathogenic strength, their numbers, and the fact that they are interchangeable. In other words, only some alteration in the mucous membranes of the upper respiratory tract will allow the germs present to develop to their specific pathogenic strength.
Bacteria. In approximate order of frequency these are pasteurella, bordetella, klebsiella, staphylococci, Escherichia coli, salmonella and Listeria.
Pasteurellosis is the disease most often cited, because rodents and lagomorphs are particularly susceptible to this germ. Pasteurellosis may take many forms in the rabbit: abscesses, mastitis, diarrhoea, metritis, wryneck, septicaemia. The rabbitry can easily become thoroughly infested, to the point where pasteurellosis can become endemic. Some pasteurella strains are more pathogenic than others. Pathogenicity can be acquired during the endemic stage, provoking an epizootic outbreak in the rabbitry or even in the entire region.
However, though pasteurella are the most common bacteria they are not the cause of most rabbit respiratory diseases. Bordetella are almost as common. In rational rabbit production the frequency of bordetella + streptococcus is as common or more common than pasteurellosis. The presence of pasteurella in a rabbitry does not indicate the presence or the probability of pasteurellosis.
Viruses. Apart from myxomatosis, which now seems more and more likely to cause pneumonia, no respiratory virus has been described in the literature. Viruses certainly do exist, however, and with rabbits as with other animal species the problem is the bacterial complications which follow them.
Parasites. There are several species which can develop in the lungs (Protostrongylus, Linguatulida, etc). They are relatively uncommon in domestic rabbits because, as with intestinal worms, an intermediate host such as a snail or dog is required. Only a laboratory analysis can reveal the presence of respiratory parasites.
RESPIRATORY DISEASE CONTROL
* Treatment
Chemotherapy (antibiotics, sulpha drugs) will be effective only if the rabbitry environment has been improved. Tetracyclines are pneumotropic antibiotics well tolerated by rabbits. Chloramphenicol is also often effective. Dosages vary according to the preparation but treatment should always last for 3 or 4 days. The medicine is best injected intramuscularly. Whenever a bacterium is isolated in the laboratory it is strongly recommended that an antibiogram be made at the same time. Sulfadimethoxine also works well for lung diseases and acts effectively against pasteurella.
Systematic preventive antibiotic treatments are both useless and dangerous.
* Prevention
There are numerous vaccines on the market of very uneven effectiveness. Most of these are pasteurella-based and sometimes bordetella-based. It is difficult to immunize rabbits against these two germs, whatever the quality of the vaccine. The main point is that bacteria are only exceptionally the direct cause of the disease, so that even if the rabbit is protected against pasteurella, it can still catch pneumonia from streptococci.
Furthermore, to be at all effective vaccination must be performed on healthy animals just after weaning and repeated 1 month later. Action is generally taken during the course of the disease only. Vaccination and chemotherapy are merely temporary measures to back up preventive hygiene.
Preventive hygiene is indispensable for success in respiratory disease control, even more than it is in digestive infections. It is covered in the last section of this chapter.
Other disorders of the rabbit
There are many rabbit diseases besides digestive and respiratory ailments. Most have disappeared from national rabbit production without the reason always being known. Others are still found in farm rabbitries but are rarely of economic importance. The following is a brief review of not uncommon diseases.
MYXOMATOSIS
This is a viral disease (Sanarelli virus) which decimated rabbits in Europe for more than 20 years after being introduced into France in 1952. The Sanarelli virus develops in certain American rabbits, Sylvilagus (cottontails), without causing the disease, thus making them dangerous carriers.
Myxomatosis is extremely contagious and can be transmitted in many ways. Biting or stinging insects such as mosquitoes and fleas are the main vectors owing to the rapidity with which they can infect animals and the distances they are able to cover. Infection by interanimal contact or from contaminated equipment is also common. It now appears certain that pulmonary contamination is possible in confined rearing.
This virus is very resistant to weather and physical changes (cold, dryness, heat) and disinfectants. Formol, however, is very active, and is recommended for disinfecting equipment.
The first symptoms are inflammation of the mucous membranes (eyelids, genital area) which thicken and form small tumours. These tumorous nodules are found first on the tips of the ears and then all over the body. The tumours adhere closely to the skin and grow until they finally deform the whole head. Numerous nodules can be felt under the skin on the back.
Respiratory forms of the disease with no other symptom also seem to be common. Clinical diagnosis is then impossible. Recovery is rare but not unheard of when the animal can eat and there is no side infection. This is not desirable, however, for the rabbit then becomes a healthy carrier of the virus.
There is no treatment, nor should there be.
Vaccination is effective and can be done with a heterologous virus (the Shope virus which causes a small benign nodule in rabbits) or a weakened form of the myxomatosis virus. In western Europe the first is more popular, in Hungary the second.
Prevention requires good hygiene and insect control, especially of lice and fleas in farm rabbitries.
Breeders or countries buying rabbits should ensure the animals have been vaccinated for more than 3 weeks but less than 2 months before purchase, and that they come from a healthy rabbitry where regular vaccinations are the rule.
FOOT PAD ABSCESSES
Foot pad abscesses are a very common complaint, familiar to all breeders. Chronic abscesses are far more frequent under the hind paws. They start as a barely visible swelling which can be felt by palpating. They may be limited to the cutaneous and conjunctive tissues. The skin becomes thick (parakeratosis) and scabby. Infection is latent and the sores may bleed. Poor cage floor hygiene can cause a heavy side infection. The abscess then covers the whole metatarsus and becomes purulent.
These abscesses are found in farm rabbitries and in rational production where mesh floors are used. Breeding animals are especially prone to this disorder.
In farm rabbitries the main cause is poor upkeep of the straw litter, which becomes damp and rots. Various infections can follow (staphylococci, fungi) but the worst is a Corynebacterium (Schmorl bacillus) which gives rise to an evil-smelling necrotic gangrene which can spread to the head and the whole body, and then to other animals (necrobacillosis).
This disease is rare where rabbits are raised on wire-mesh floors, but sore hocks (caused by staphylococcus) are much more common than in rabbitries where straw litter is used. Poor quality, rough or twisted wires, wrong mesh size (too wide), and rust are the main culprits, all fostering the development of foot pad abscesses. It is difficult to raise heavy rabbit breeds on wire mesh.
The control of foot and hock diseases is primarily preventive:
* choice of medium-weight breeds and animals whose foot pads are well furred to protect the skin, such as the New Zealand White and the Californian;
* use of thick, galvanized, welded wire mesh (mesh size 13-15 mm). It should not irritate the palm of the hand when rubbed;
* straw litter always kept dry and clean;
* frequent washing and disinfecting of cages.
Treatment is difficult. When there is no obvious suppuration the sores may be treated every day and then every 2 days with strong disinfectants such as iodine, Fehling liquor, paraffin oil and permanganate. The antifungoid action of iodine and permanganate is useful too in units using the litter system, which fosters complications with fungi. Antibiotic ointments are not recommended because the treatment is long and expensive and the ointments soften the skin.
When the abscesses become purulent or the fore-paws are affected the infection is then incurable and the animals should be culled. If other abscesses are noted, especially on the head (necrobacillosis), the bodies should be burnt or buried deep. Foot pad abscesses make it practically impossible for males to mate.
BUCK-TEETH
Buck-teeth prevent the upper and lower incisors from touching and so they do not wear down. The incisors keep growing and eventually prevent the rabbit from eating. Buck-teeth may be hereditary (jaw malformation), or the result of injury (teeth broken against wire mesh). There is no connection with the type of feed-forage, hard granulated feeds, and so on.
The only prevention is breeding. Look carefully at the teeth when buying or choosing a breeding animal. Treatment consists of cutting the teeth with sharp pliers right down to the gums every 15-21 days.
EAR AND SKIN MANGE
Ear canker or mange is very common. The symptoms are external otitis, and yellow or brown scabs in the ear canal. The course of the disease can be very long. The scabs become waxy and invade the whole ear. The inside of the ear becomes scaly.
This is a parasitic disease caused by a mite (Psoroptes or Chorioptes) and frequently complicated by bacterial infection. The middle ear may then be affected, causing wryneck (the rabbit's head is held constantly to one side).
Treatment can be effective if the disease is caught in the very early stages, that is, as soon as small yellow-brown deposits are noticed in the ear. Insecticides are applied locally in the ear. Organophosphates (for example, malathion) are preferable to organochlorines (DDT, lindane) which, though very active, are dangerous to man. Glycerine, iodized oil or cresyl oil are also effective with frequent applications.
Prevention involves culling rabbits whose external ear is deeply affected, and treating all other rabbits for several days in a row and then every fortnight. Throughout the treatment the straw litter must be changed frequently as the parasites can stay alive in the litter for a long time.
Skin mange is much less common. Today it is only found in poorly managed rabbitries. Lesions start at the edge of the lips, nostrils and eyes, spreading to the head and fore-paws as rabbits frequently rub their heads. The skin dries, the hair falls out and the skin becomes scaly and finally scabby. The skin mange mites, Sarcoptes and Notoedres, are not of the same family as ear canker mites. Treatment is the same, but prevention measures (culling diseased rabbits, cleaning cages) must be stricter.
SKIN DISEASES
* Ringworm
Ringworm, also called dermatomycosis or trichophytosis, is a skin and hair disorder. Not very common in farm rabbitries, it is widespread in rational rabbit production. It starts with circular bald patches, usually on the nose. The hair looks clipped and the skin is irritated and inflamed. More small patches appear on the head, ears and fore-paws, and then over the whole body. On the oldest lesions the hair can be seen growing again in the centre.
It is a very contagious infection that can sometimes be transmitted to humans, though it is more commonly transmitted to other domestic animals such as dogs and cats. Ringworm is caused by microscopic fungi that can belong to different families (Trichophyton, Microsporum, Achorion) and are not specific to rabbits. There is no economic loss as long as infestation is light.
Treatment is long and costly. An antimycotic (griseofulvin) is administered in the feed for about 10 days. During treatment all equipment should be frequently cleaned and disinfected, in a 5 percent formal solution for example. Many producers, successfully it seems, sprinkle powdered sulphur (sulphur flowers) on the ground, cages and nesting boxes. In small rabbitries local treatment can be applied with antimycotics in powder or liquid form (tincture of iodine and other dyes), but preventive hygiene should accompany the treatment. Badly afflicted animals should be culled and domestic animals treated.
As well as the lice and fleas that are specific to rabbits, ectoparasites of other animal species (particularly poultry) can also bother rabbits. Not found in rational rabbit production, these farm rabbitry ectoparasites can harm production and, worst of all, they are the vectors of many diseases, including myxomatosis. With good hygiene and external antiparasitic preparations they can be rapidly eliminated.
TRICHOPHAGY
Trichophagy or fur-eating occurs both in farm rabbitries and in units using wire-mesh floors. The animals eat each other's fur and end up with bare backs and flanks. All sorts of diagnoses have been advanced: unbalanced rations, behavioural problems, unsuitable environment, amount of light, overpopulation, genetics and so forth. It was very widespread when wire-mesh cages were first used extensively, but seems to be declining with the general improvement in production conditions (equipment, feed, strain).
There is no exact preventive measure and no specific treatment.
OTHER DISEASES
Other diseases that are transmissible from rabbits to humans (or that are common to both) include ringworm; gangrene of the paws and head, caused by Spherophorus necrophoris; hydatidosis or coenurosis, caused by larvae of dog and cat tapeworm; and trypanosomiasis. By contrast, neither rabbit variola (pox virus) nor rabbit syphilis (Treponema cuniculi) can be transmitted to humans.
Zoonoses
Zoonoses are diseases shared by many animal species, especially man. Most have no special feature peculiar to rabbits and are rarely contracted by them (rabies, tetanus, etc). So only a few are mentioned here, either because they can be dangerous to people or because the appearance of the disease in the rabbit reveals its existence on the farm or in the village.
Zoonoses have apparently never been identified in rational rabbit production. This is because contamination is usually spread by forages polluted by other animal species. Zoonoses are also usually adult diseases; the early slaughter of animals (10-12 weeks) limits their spread.
When these diseases are suspected the dead animals should be burnt or buried, and human hygiene should be intensified.
Though antibiotic treatments may be effective in certain cases it is best not to treat but to cull the entire stock. Good hygiene is the only prevention. Apart from the usual rules of cleanliness, forage must be cut and stored with special care. Rats and mice are formidable propagators of these diseases.
Rat extermination around rabbitries is fundamental.
TUBERCULOSIS
This disease is very rarely reported in rabbits. Nevertheless it does exist and may be of avian, bovine or human origin (in decreasing order of frequency). The rabbit is very resistant to tuberculosis, so the disease evolves very slowly. The lesions, which are the sole indication of tuberculosis, can only be seen in breeding animals. The main organ affected is the lungs, and less frequently the liver, intestine and kidneys. The spleen is very rarely affected.
The classic tubercular nodules are found in the parenchyma of these organs, often containing an almost solid cheese-like pus.
PSEUDOTUBERCULOSIS
This is more common in guineapigs, wild rabbits and hares than in domestic rabbits reared on straw litter. It has almost disappeared with modern wire-mesh cage rabbit production. Pseudotuberculosis is one cause of synovial arthritis in man. The germ Yersinia pseudotuberculosis provokes numerous whitish nodular lesions on the intestinal viscera, especially the spleen, which becomes enlarged. These nodules, ranging in size from a lentil to a chickpea, are sometimes amalgamated. They are scattered throughout the abdominal cavity but are rarely found in the lungs.
Apart from a steady weight loss there are no symptoms to diagnose. The disease can easily be recognized by post-mortem examination.
TRYPANOSOMIASIS
There are few data on this disease. Various findings from Africa on the subject, while not contradictory, are not uniform.
It has been demonstrated that rabbits can contract trypanosomiasis experimentally or in particular circumstances. They are particularly susceptible to Trypanosoma brucei.
There are reportedly some rabbitries in tsetse fly areas, for instance in Cote d'Ivoire, with no recorded cases of spontaneous outbreaks of trypanosomiasis in rabbits. Trypanosomiasis has caused some problems in Mozambique, however. It has been reported that its symptoms are oddly like those of myxomatosis.
LISTERIOSIS
This disease is less rare than tularaemia, and still appears sporadically in farm rabbitries. A septicaemic disease caused by Listeria monocytogenes, it is very difficult to diagnose clinically. Listeriosis should be suspected when the following symptoms appear on the farm:
* nervous upsets: photophobia, spasms, wryneck;
* abortions in does or ewes;
* miliary necrosis of the liver and spleen (without enlargement).
TULARAEMIA (RABBIT FEVER)
This very contagious disease is common in hares, but rabbits seldom contract it. Its significance is the danger it represents for man. A bacterial disease (Francisella tularensis), it gives rise to a high fever, leaving the animals in a semicomatose state. Lesions cause enlargement and congestion of the spleen. The liver is often dotted with numerous tiny grayish-white spots (miliary necrosis) about the size of a grain of millet.
TOXOPLASMOSIS
Toxoplasmosis is unquestionably more common in farm rabbitries than is generally believed. It is caused by the intermediary stage of an internal cat and dog parasite, Isospora. The course of the disease does not usually produce symptoms, though there may be jerky nervous reactions. The lesions are translucent cysts in the brain, and in muscles or viscera. Often the spleen is enlarged.
Diseases and disorders associated with reproduction
Respiratory infections
Respiratory ailments are the main disorders affecting pregnant rabbits in closed rearing. In intensive production, apart from the environmental causes described earlier, lactation must be added as a contributing cause. In young nursing does, hard-to-diagnose ailments can be complicated by acute or subacute pneumonia. The doe may die before weaning her litter or have to be culled shortly afterwards.
DIGESTIVE DISORDERS AND ENTEROTOXAEMIA
Digestive diseases are far less serious in adult animals than in growing rabbits. The classic coccidiosis-type diarrhoea is rare in adults.
Intestinal parasitism (coccidiosis, strongylosis) will be latent or chronic, fostering the appearance of other diseases.
Enterotoxaemia is more common, especially in farm rabbitries. With or without mucoid enteritis it can develop very rapidly ( 1-7 days). Most often it occurs in late pregnancy or mid-lactation, sometimes in association with symptoms of acute pneumonia. In traditional rabbitries, complications of paresis or paraplegia are common, especially in fat, overfed does working at low-intensity breeding rates. Control in this case involves adapting the reproduction rate to the feeding capacities of the production unit. There is no treatment.
METABOLIC DISORDERS
Some 25-30 percent of does die in intensive production, usually with no warning symptoms. Mortality occurs in mid-lactation in young first and second-litter females and in the latter stages of pregnancy in older does. Often called enterotoxaemia, this illness is certainly not of infectious origin, though bacterial complications are common. It is rather more like a metabolic disorder, such as milk fever in ruminants or eclampsia in women. Its etiology is still not clear. There is no curative treatment. Mortality can sometimes be reduced by preventive doses of calcium in drinking water or parenteral injections (Ca gluconate) just before kindling.
GENITAL INFECTIONS
The external genital organs (vulva, penis, scrotum) can be the site of specific venereal diseases. The best known is rabbit syphilis or vent disease, caused by a spirochete ( Treponema cuniculi). It has never been reported in rational rabbit production, but vent disease is not exceptional in rural rabbitries. Inflamed lesions become ulcerated. Bucks are often affected (orchitis, balanitis) and transmit the disease, which can turn enzootic. This is a benign disease which impedes mating. It can easily be treated with antibiotics (penicillin, tetracycline).
Attention: this disease can be confused with the onset of myxomatosis!
The internal genital organs can also become infected. These far more serious, far more common infections make reproduction impossible.
* Metritis
Metritis or white discharge, a uterine infection, is often associated with mastitis and respiratory complaints. It is a major rabbit disease.
One symptom of metritis is an abnormal frequency of sterile does and mastitis in the rabbitry. Abortion, which is usually rare, may become more common. Metritis shows up at post-mortem: the uterus is thickened and poorly retracted and there may be abscesses at the last embryo implantation site, sometimes covering the whole uterus (pyometris).
Etiology is complex. Gestation and kindling are obviously contributing causes, but hygiene is a determining factor, and a chronic pasteurellosis in the rabbitry could be the culprit. The most common germs are nonspecific: staphylococci, pasteurella. The specific germs such as toxoplasm, Listeria and Salmonella are much less common. Specific infections are likely if there is widespread abortion.
Antibiotics can be given, especially at the onset of the disease. But they will not be effective unless the most advanced cases are culled- very thin does, or does with purulent mastitis or symptoms of pneumonia or purulent coryza.
Preventive medicine, in this case vaccination, is only valid for pasteurellosis (see section on respiratory diseases). Preventive hygiene is decisive in controlling internal genital diseases.
ABSCESSES AND MASTITIS
Abscesses are very common in rabbits. They sometimes grow to enormous size, and develop very quickly without any apparent change in the animal's health. There are two preferential sites in does: the submaxillary area and the teats. These and foot abscesses are the main reasons for culling breeding does.
Most often the cause is Staphylococcus aureus, but other germs may be present. The worst are pasteurella, which can make the disease epizootic and lead to numerous complications (pneumonia, septicaemia, abortion). Mastitis is common in units with mesh floors and is probably fostered by congestion caused by chilling. When mastitis is in the congestive stage (hard, reddened mammary gland but no pus) the disease may be staved off by a 3-day antibiotic treatment and the local application of astringents (vinegar) twice daily to aid decongestion. It is uneconomical to treat abscesses or purulent mastitis.
NONINFECTIOUS REPRODUCTION PROBLEMS
* Sterility
Absolute sterility is relatively rare. "Sterility epidemics" are usually seasonal and can often be traced to insufficient light (less than 14-16 hours). Sterility otherwise occurs after 1 or several kindlings (see previous chapter). Does serviced 3 times with no results should be culled for both hygiene and economy.
* Twisted uterus
Cases of twisted uterus are not uncommon. This is discovered during post-mortems on does which die during gestation. The causes are not clear. Overcrowding of the uterus and disturbance of does are frequent explanations.
. Delayed birth
Delayed birth often occurs with small litters (1-3). Foetal retentions are common in this case, invalidating the doe economically. In modern production, birth is systematically induced by injections of ocytocine on day 33 of pregnancy (servicing on day zero).
* Parturition outside the nest box
Young first-litter females are the usual offenders. Disturbances, or mice in the nesting box, are possible causes.
* Prolapsus of the vagina
There is no treatment for prolapses of the vagina.
* Cannibalism
Real cannibalism due to abnormal behaviour in the doe is exceptional. The female usually eats only those young which are already virtually dead but still warm. This may happen a few hours or days after parturition. Insufficient drinking water after parturition is considered a cause in farm rabbitries, and this could well be the true reason.
* Abandonment of the litter
This is most often done by young females whose milk has not let down, or has let down too late. A doe that abandons 2 litters should be culled.
THE NEST AND YOUNG RABBIT MORTALITY
Compared with other domestic animals, rabbits are still virtually in the foetal stage at birth.
The survival of newborn rabbits, and hence the ultimate success of the rabbitry, is closely related to the quality and hygiene of the litter's immediate environment.
If the amount and type of materials used for the nest (straw, wood shavings, hay, etc) are inadequate during the first few days, the newborn rabbits will get cold and death is then inevitable. The doe does little to intervene. She pulls fur to help make the nest; she nurses her young once a day and sometimes she will defend access to the nest, but she does not care directly for the young. If the nest box is poorly designed and the young are able to get out after the first few days, the doe will not put them back.
If nest hygiene is poor (droppings, dampness) or if the mother is sick (mastitis, coryza) the young will develop a nostril-blocking rhinitis within a few hours. Their sense of smell is crucial as it guides them to the mother's teats. Small staphylococcic abscesses can quickly develop on the young rabbits' bodies (belly, groin, tarsus) in these conditions.
In modern French rabbitries with highly prolific does, an intensive reproduction system and adequate environmental conditions, an estimated 57 percent of the young are stillborn and another 16-20 percent normally die before weaning. About a third of this mortality figure is accounted for by precocious dam mortality. Some of the young can be saved by fostering 2 or 3 to another nursing mother with young of the same age. The remainder of the losses take place during the first 2 weeks of lactation. Occasionally entire litters are lost during the first 4-5 days.
The etiology of these mortalities is not known, but it seems to have more to do with the doe's state (lactation?) than with any particular disease of the newborn rabbits.
These figures indicate that a mortality rate of less than 15-20 percent should not be considered catastrophic. On the other hand, after the first 1520 days of lactation young rabbit mortality should be very low. If it is not the dam should be examined for mastitis or coryza. Cage and nest box hygiene should be checked. Pre-weaning diarrhoea (30-35 days) is a sign of inadequate hygiene. Coccidiosis indicates very poor hygiene.
Preventive hygiene
The word prevention has been constantly repeated throughout this chapter as essential for successful rabbit production. Careful hygiene is usually enough to prevent major disease crises. Preventive medicines (vaccinations, anticoccidiosis treatments, etc) have been described. They are not widely used in rabbit production. The basic rules of preventive hygiene are now set down in detail.
LOCATION AND DESIGN OF THE RABBITRY
It has been emphasized from the outset that rabbits must have an environment in which they do not constantly have to withstand external disturbances and aggression.
The rabbitry should be located whenever possible far from such nuisances as noise and dust (dust carries microbes), sheltered from the prevailing winds, and in hot countries shaded from the sun.
Rat and mice extermination should be considered, as both are formidable, healthy carriers of diseases to which rabbits are susceptible.
Cleaning should be constantly kept in mind in the designing and building of a rabbitry. Nothing that cannot easily be cleaned and disinfected should be allowed. The rabbit's immediate surroundings (cage, feeding racks and drinkers) in particular should be portable, so they can be regularly removed, cleaned, dried and disinfected. In completely closed buildings the ventilation should be carefully designed for flow without draught. Where ventilation is used, forced-air ventilation is preferable, as it keeps insects out and makes it possible to control the air flow by adding or removing vents.
Some authors insist that in tropical countries the interior of the building should be sufficiently protected to act as a buffer against swings in temperature and humidity, especially during the rainy season, to cut down the incidence of pulmonary diseases. As an example, a rabbitry in Burkina Faso built with local materials (laterite bricks, palm framework, straw roofing) recorded a much lower range in temperature variations than did a "strong" building made of construction blocks with a tin roof.
Where possible, metal should be used for the wire-mesh hutch and accessories as it is the easiest material to clean and disinfect.
CONSTANT HYGIENE
The rabbit's excitability is a contributing factor in illness. Casual visitors such as feed suppliers, rabbit buyers and other breeders (who are vectors of diseases from other rabbitries) should be barred. Rabbits should be protected against dogs, cats, and small wild carnivores.
Feed and water hygiene is basic as both can carry numerous rabbit diseases (coccidiosis, worms). Feed should be stored out of the reach of domestic animals. It should be distributed in troughs or racks, but never on the ground. Drinkers should never be set on the ground.
Rabbits drink a lot of water, but they won't drink dirty water. Water is the ideal medium for coccidia sporulation. Accordingly it should be changed and drinkers cleaned often.
Cage and nest hygiene is particularly important while the does are nursing. In wire-mesh hutches the cage must be removed and cleaned after each kindling. In farm rabbitries the straw litter must be renewed often. After kindling any stillborn young should be removed from the nest and the nest remade if necessary. Contrary to widespread belief, a doe will not abandon her young if they have been touched. It is only necessary to keep the doe out of the nest during the cleaning operation.
After weaning, if straw litter is used it should be kept clean and dry. The more animals per cage, the more difficult this is. In every type of production system weaning demands scrupulously clean, disinfected, dry cages. Weaning is one of the crucial moments in rabbit production. Avoid transporting the animals, mixing up litters and using questionable cages. Successful production depends on these details.
It is also necessary to work constantly against any increase in bacterial infection. Chronically sick animals (with coryza, pneumonia, mastitis, abscesses), especially breeding animals, must be culled. A sick breeding animal in a rabbitry is of small value compared to the danger it represents for the rest of the stock, the cost and uncertain outcome of treatment, and the possibility of its quick replacement (sexual maturity at 4 months).
In completely closed buildings the control of bacterial infection should include the maintenance of walls, ceilings and especially floors. Damp or dusty floors are a permanent source of air pollution.
The early slaughter (10-12 weeks) of animals for market is also a form of preventive hygiene. Many diseases take several months to develop before becoming contagious, especially in small or farm rabbitries.
Man is the most dangerous permanent vector of disease. He can bring in contaminants from the outside, so he should wash his hands before entering, and don footgear and a smock which always remain inside the rabbitry. Only a human being can palpate a doe suffering from mastitis and then systematically go on to infect all the mammary glands of the females to be palpated that day. Clean hands are extremely important, especially when handling animals and distributing feed and forage.
Preventive medicines to control parasitic diseases also help to maintain a healthy environment. Many parasites undermine the animals' state of health without causing directly perceptible losses, and open the way for a great variety of infections, but the systematic use of antibiotics as a preventive measure is not at all recommended. The abuse of antiparasitic drugs, especially of sulpha drugs, does far more harm than good. All drugs are poisons which must be used with caution.
* Disinfecting
Disinfecting the rabbitry should be a routine matter that follows some simple rules:
Cleaning. Dirty equipment cannot be disinfected. It must be washed first, or if water is short, carefully scraped and brushed.
Drying. Proper drying is in itself a first step towards disinfecting equipment.
Chemical or physical disinfecting. It should not be forgotten in this context that sundrying well-cleaned equipment for several days is a simple, cost-free and very efficient means of disinfecting. The only preconditions are a storage area off limits to domestic animals and a reserve supply of extra equipment so that cleaning and disinfecting time will not cut into production time.
In industrial production, pressurized steam-cleaning equipment is indispensable.
SANITARY ISOLATION
No matter what precautions are taken, after 1, 2 or 3 years health problems will become less and less easy to control. Imperceptibly productivity will decrease, despite an increase in hygiene and care and in the experience of the breeder. This has to do with rising levels of bacterial infection in the rabbitry, coupled no doubt with the irreversible presence of harmful microflora and microfauna in the animals.
Sanitary isolation becomes essential at this point. All rabbits in the affected section of the rabbitry must be culled. All equipment must be cleaned, repaired and disinfected. After this is done the area must be left vacant for some time (1-2 weeks) before introducing new rabbits.
Some small farm rabbitries have 2 premises which they alternate every year. This is a kind of 1-year sanitary isolation which has proved very effective.

Conclusions
Biological considerations
The design of rabbit housing is governed by the behavioural characteristics of the animals and their reactions to environmental temperature and humidity.
RABBIT BEHAVIOUR
Some kinds of behaviour have already been analysed in this book and others have been mentioned briefly. They all have an influence on rabbit housing so they will be summarized at this point. Since the domestication of the rabbit is recent in terms of species evolution (200-3(U) generations at most) the behaviour of the domestic rabbit is still much like that of the wild rabbit. The reactions of wild rabbits will often provide explanations for the problems of housing domestic rabbits and suggest ways of solving them.
* Territorial behaviour
Wild rabbits live in sedentary fashion in a territory whose size depends on the conditions of food supply. They mark their territory, their fellows and their offspring with the aid of a gland found in hair follicles under the chin. The bucks also mark off their territory with their urine. The rabbits dig burrows in which they take shelter at the slightest alert. There they live in a 'society". Before parturition' however, the doe digs a special burrow where her young are born and where she comes once a day to nurse them.
This is why domestic rabbits should have durable living quarters, providing either a refuge from disturbances or a peaceful environment that makes a refuge unnecessary. Any new and sudden change (noise, presence, smell) will make the first rabbit in the group to notice the disquieting novelty thump his hind foot to warn his fellows of danger. To prevent panic in the rabbitry the breeder should take care that changes that might upset the animals are avoided.
When a rabbit is put in a new cage he will explore it and then mark it with his smell. The more strange odours there are in the cage the longer this task will take.
The burrow is not only a refuge in case of alert, it is also a rest area during the day, as rabbits are mostly nocturnal. Temperature and humidity are far more constant in the burrow than outside.
* Social behaviour
Wild rabbits live in colonies in which females outnumber males. Each female, with or without offspring, attacks the young of other does. Bucks act as moderators at this stage. When the young males reach puberty, however, the adult males try to eliminate them as rivals by castrating them.
The method used in rational European rabbit production to prevent such conflicts is to isolate each adult rabbit in an individual cage. Before puberty, young rabbits can be raised in groups. Attempts to rear breeding animals in groups are bound to fail because the does are so aggressive towards the young, especially when the animals' living space is cramped. Females without young can be reared in groups provided each female has at least half a square metre of space for herself.
* Sexual behaviour
Ovulation in the does is brought on by mating (see Chapter 3, Reproduction), so one might expect mating to be possible on a quasi-permanent basis. In fact does do have a behavioural cycle of acceptance of the male but unfortunately this varies greatly from one doe to the next. Attempts at servicing often have to be repeated, which means the animals must be moved about a great deal.
The buck is so very territorial that when he is put in a female's cage his first act is to mark this new territory with his smell, while the doe tries to eliminate the intruder. But if a doe is put in a buck's cage the immediate reaction of both animals is sexual. For a receptive doe preparation for mating takes 20-120 seconds, and the act itself less than a second. For servicing therefore it is the doe that should be moved. This is relatively easy because does are calmer and weigh less than bucks (3-6 kg). For mating to be supervised, the animals need to be visible in all parts of the cage. Access to the buck's cage should be simple so that the does can be easily introduced and removed.
With this kind of mating, people have to move the animals physically within the rabbitry and this will influence the planning of the general layout of the unit to limit the distances to be covered. The rather unsatisfactory results obtained with special cages reserved for mating should be mentioned. Many males waste a lot of time marking a mating cage that is impregnated with the smell of their predecessor, and the cage is also a possible site for the spread of diseases.
* Maternal behaviour
Before kindling, the doe makes a nest with various materials plus fur she pulls from her abdomen. The wild doe's nest is made at the end of the private burrow she digs for kindling. The domestic rabbit does not usually have the opportunity to do this, so a private area should be set apart for her. In farm rabbitries using straw litter the doe might be satisfied to dig into the straw to make a nest. But producers have noticed that it is preferable to provide her with a nest box approximately reproducing the natural burrow.
A box like this is useful in a farm rabbitry and essential in wire cage production. After the young are born (6-12 per litter), the doe nurses them once every 24 hours for about a month. To allow the motor coordination and heat-regulation capacity of the baby rabbits to develop, the nesting box should be maintained for at least 2 weeks. It should be big enough to accommodate the doe and her litter during nursing.
* Feeding behaviour
Rabbits will drink and eat at any time in the 24 hours, though they tend to feed nocturnally. Intake is rather slow, even if the animals' feed is rationed. Feed and water should therefore be available over periods of several hours, whether feed is rationed or ad lib. The feed must not be allowed to get dirty, which is inevitable if it is strewn on the ground (see Chapter 5, Pathology).
From the age of 3 weeks young rabbits begin to eat the same feed as the doe. Their small size allows them to slip easily into forage racks or dry feed hoppers, so this equipment must be designed to keep them out.
HYGIENE, HABITAT AND BREEDS
There would be no point in reiterating here all the rules of hygiene dealt with in other chapters, particularly preventive hygiene. However, the design of the rabbitry will be heavily influenced by some of these rules.
One of the major rabbit diseases in traditional small-scale production using straw litter is coccidiosis. Contamination is via oocysts eliminated with the faeces. Breeders have cut the incidence of this disease by using wire-mesh floors through which the excrement drops.
The wire-mesh flooring system, combined more recently with single, portable, interchangeable cages, has led to considerable progress in disinfecting equipment. Some diseases have been cut down or even wholly eliminated. But not all rabbit breeds can adapt to this type of flooring. Heavy or nervous breeds, in particular, are subject to sore hocks, a bacterial infection developing on the foot pads and irritated by the wire mesh (too much weight per square cm). The risk is greater when the animals are raised in environments with high temperatures (31-32°C), or very high humidity (constant relative humidity above 85 percent), or when the rabbits are frequently under stress, when they thump their hind feet on the ground to warn the other rabbits of impending danger. A mesh floor also cannot be insulated, and rabbits are more liable to respiratory ailments if air flow is not controlled.
Breeders therefore have to make a decision: either they rear New Zealand White or Californian breeds, which have been adapted to mesh flooring, and thus meet modern hygiene standards, or else they rear heavier or more excitable breeds-but then how do they control coccidiosis and other diseases?
As well as these hygiene-linked problems there are other advantages and disadvantages with both mesh floors and traditional straw litter. The mesh floor through which droppings can fall makes possible automatic cleaning or very infrequent cleaning (droppings accumulate under cages). But it also makes the rabbits very dependent on the microclimate or ventilation in the rabbitry. Straw litter, on the other hand, has to be cleaned often (at least once a week) so the producer has to have the material on hand (straw, wood shavings, etc). An advantage is that a cage with a straw litter floor can be put almost anywhere, as the cage itself partly insulates the animals from variations in the external climate.
In Europe today most new production units use solely wire-mesh cages and New Zealand White or Californian rabbits. But this implies that the genetic pool of other breeds is being overlooked. Would it not be possible to design other types of flooring, recognizing that slatted floors have never been very satisfactory'? Whatever the answer, for many developing countries the wire-mesh cage will probably be only a theoretical solution for many years to come, until the special mesh necessary is made available to producers at reasonable prices.
ENVIRONMENT
* Temperature
Temperature is the most important factor as it directly affects a number of elements. Rabbits have constant internal (rectal) temperature so heat production and losses must vary to maintain body temperature (Table 46). They do this by modifying their feed intake level (regulating production), as described in the chapter on nutrition. They use 3 devices to modify heat losses: general body position, breathing rate and peripheral temperature, especially ear temperature (Table 46).
TABLE 46.-EXPORTATION OF HEAT, RECTAL TEMPERATURE AND EAR TEMPERATURE IN ADULT NEW ZEALAND WHITE RABBITS, ACCORDING TO AMBIENT TEMPERATURE

20 3.s ± 0.76 0.79 ± 0.22 39.0 ± 0.3 23.2 ± 0.9
SOURCE: Gonzalez et al, 1971.
If ambient temperature is low (below 10°C) the animals curl up to minimize the total area losing heat and lower their ear temperature. If the temperature is high (above 25-30°C), the animals stretch out so they can lose as much heat as possible by radiation and convection, and step up their ear temperature. The ears function like a car radiator. The efficiency of the cooling system depends on the air speed around the animal. At the same time the animal pants to increase heat losses through evaporation of water (latent heat). The sweat glands are not functional in rabbits and the only controlled means of latent heat evacuation is by altering the breathing rate. Perspiration (the evacuation of water through the skin) is never great because of the fur.
These systems work between 0°C and 30°C, but when ambient temperatures reach (mainly when they exceed) 35°C, rabbits can no longer regulate their internal temperature and heat prostration sets in.
The regulation methods described above, based on observation of adult animals, are applicable to young rabbits from the age of about 1 month, when they can move about and feed themselves and the juvenile coat has grown. Heat regulation of newborn rabbits is somewhat different: they have no fur and cannot correctly adjust their food intake as the doe's milk production is independent of their needs. At birth they have rather good fat reserves which help them maintain body temperature if 2 conditions are met. The surrounding temperature must be at least 28°C (3032°C if possible), and they must have other young to huddle against to reduce heat losses.
At birth, young rabbits cannot modify their body shape by curling up. The only way they can limit heat loss through convection and radiation is to huddle together with the other young in the litter. In fact, if ambient temperature varies during the day the young rabbits will move apart when the temperature is high and huddle back together when it goes down. But a sudden temperature drop may well exhaust their thermoregulation potential before they can get back in the huddle, and they can die of cold 10 cm away from the group. The newborn rabbit is blind and the incomplete myelinization of the nervous system that governs motor control hampers coordinated movement. The producer must make sure the temperature in the nest remains constant to prevent this sort of accident.
* Humidity
Rabbits are sensitive to very low humidity (below 55 percent) but not to very high humidity. This may be explained by the fact that wild rabbits spend much of their lives in underground burrows with a humidity level near saturation point (100 percent).
The rabbit has more to fear from abrupt changes in humidity. Constant humidity is therefore the best solution, and this will depend on the housing design. French breeders find 60-65 percent humidity levels successful, using only auxiliary heating in winter.
While the humidity level does not seem to trouble the rabbit in moderate temperatures, this is not so with temperature extremes.
When the temperature is too high (close to the rabbit's body temperature) and humidity is also high, latent heat can no longer be exported as water vapour as little water can evaporate. The result is discomfort which can be followed by prostration. Very hot spells with near 100 percent humidity can cause serious problems. Unfortunately this often occurs in tropical climates during the rainy season.
When the temperature is too low and humidity close to saturation point, water condenses on poorly insulated walls, especially at heat bridges. Water is a good heat conductor and so the cold becomes more penetrating, causing heat losses in the animals through convection and conduction. Digestive and respiratory disorders often follow. When the surrounding air is cold, excess humidity modifies the secretion and viscosity of the mucus protecting the upper respiratory apparatus.
Air which is too dry (below 60 percent relative humidity) and too hot is even more dangerous. Not only does it upset the secretion of mucus
but the ensuing evaporation shrinks the size of the droplets carrying infectious agents, enabling them to penetrate more easily the respiratory apparatus.
* Ventilation
The rabbitry must have a certain minimum of ventilation to evacuate the harmful gases given off by the rabbits (CO[2]) or the straw litter and excrement (NH[3], H[2]S, CH[4], and so on); and to renew the oxygen and get rid of excess humidity (evaporation, the animals' breath) and excess heat given off by the rabbits.
Ventilation needs can vary enormously, depending especially on climate, cage type and population density. Ventilation standards for temperate climates based on several French studies are given in Table 47. This table combines the various parameters (temperature, air flow, humidity) to determine optimum air flow per kg of rabbit liveweight. If there is an imbalance, especially between air flow and temperature, accidents like those illustrated in Figure 21 occur.
It is relatively easy and cheap to measure temperature and humidity, but exact air speed measurement requires sophisticated, expensive, hard-to-get equipment such as a hot-wire anemometer (a revolving-cup anemometer is not sensitive enough). However, the producer can estimate the rate of air flow near rabbits by using a candle flame, as shown in Figure 22.
High ammonia air levels-20-30 parts per million (ppm)-greatly weaken the rabbits' upper respiratory tract and open the door to bacteria such as pasteurella and bordetella. To keep NH[3] air levels down, ventilation can be increased. The risk is then overventilation, with all the negative consequences illustrated in Figure 21.

A more effective solution is to limit NH[3] production from fermenting floor litter (droppings and urine) by removing the litter quickly or keeping it dry. The maximum permissible NH[3] content in the air rabbits breathe is 5 ppm.
LIGHTING
Few studies have been made on the influence of light on rabbits, and these are almost exclusively concerned with the duration of lighting and seldom with light intensity. Furthermore practical recommendations on lighting are based more on observations in rabbitries than on experimental findings.
Exposure to light for 8 out of 24 hours favours spermatogenesis and sexual activity in bucks. Conversely, exposure for 14-16 hours a day favours female sexual activity and fertilization. In rational European production all breeding animals of both sexes get 16 hours of light. The slight drop in male sexual activity is amply compensated by good female reproduction rates (acceptance of the male and fertilization).
Performance is more constant in windowless rabbitries with artificial lighting than in rabbitries which supplement sunlight by artificial lighting. Twenty-four-hour light trials caused reproduction disturbances in rabbits. It therefore seems best to limit the duration to 16 hours.
Observations from different rabbitries indicate that breeding does need considerable luminosity, at least 30-40 lux. In fact, many breeders who light their premises for 16 hours a day but not uniformly find that the does receiving the least light have the worst reproduction performance cards. When light distribution is made uniform, reproduction performance picks up.
In European rabbitries lighting is provided by incandescent lamps or fluorescent tubes (neon daylight type). The latter provide the necessary lux at a lower energy cost than incandescent lamps, but their installation cost is much higher. For flat-deck units the power consumption is 3-5 W/m2 with light sources located no more than 3 m from the animals.
Very young rabbits do not really need light, but 15-16 hours per day do no harm. Twenty-four-hour lighting, however, can cause disturbances which are hard to explain, such as diarrhoea unrelated to changes in the rate of caecotrophy. So breeders use either sunlight (in rabbitries with windows) or artificial lighting for 1-2 hours a day to satisfy the young rabbits' needs, at a set time so as not to disturb caecotrophic behaviour. A much weaker light can be used for young rabbits.
Rabbitry equipment
Equipment in direct contact with the rabbits or their excrement becomes contaminated by the bacteria, viruses and fungi that surround the animals. Cages, fittings and building walls must be designed so they can be easily cleaned, disinfected or replaced in order that they do not in turn become sources of contamination.
Portable components which can be cleaned outside the rabbitry building are especially recommended. Away from the rabbits stronger cleaning agents and more effective methods can be used-powerful disinfectants, lengthy soaking, prolonged exposure to the sun's rays.
Some materials are easier than others to disinfect. Wood is very hard to clean, but it can be periodically replaced in countries where it is plentiful. Plywood can be disinfected by steeping it in disinfectant solutions. Galvanized iron is easy to clean and disinfect but unlike wood is a poor insulator. Concrete, provided it is smooth, can be cleaned and disinfected, but it is practically impossible to have portable concrete installations because of the weight. Glazed earthenware can also be used for certain accessories (troughs, or even nest boxes).
CAGING
* Cages (hutches) with straw litter
Traditional European rabbitries use straw litter. This material can be replaced by any other dry fibrous product which is not rough to the touch (soft shavings, hay, industrial cotton waste and so on). The cages are either of concrete (lasting 15-30 years) or wood (lasting not more than 2 years). Cages for breeding animals usually have a 60-70 cm x 80-100 cm floor space at least, and are 50-60 cm high. Identical cages are often used for fattening 5-6 young rabbits (to 2.5-2.8 kg). The litter should be replaced weekly to control parasitism.
A variation called "deep litter" is used in slightly taller cages. The floor is covered with a bed (minimum thickness 15-20 cm) of absorbent material (turf, wood shavings) evenly covered with straw. Every 6-7 weeks the whole lot, absorbing layer plus accumulated straw, has to be replaced. This system saves labour in cleaning and has the advantage of the comfort provided by the straw, but it does use a great deal of absorbent material so it is only applicable where this material is both readily available and cheap.
* Cages without litter
In some regions rabbits are raised on litterless floors (hard earth or wooden planking). The hygienic conditions are nearly always deplorable (uncontrolled local humidity favouring parasitism), despite daily cleaning. This system is not recommended because of the health risks involved.
The solution to the problem of changing litter has been to separate the animal from its excrement as soon as this is dropped. The rabbits are raised above the ground on a wire-mesh or slatted floor. Wire-mesh floors should be thick enough not to injure the pads of the rabbits' feet (diameter 2.4 mm, minimum 2 mm); the mesh should be wide enough to let the droppings fall through (diameter 1-1.3 cm, according to feed) but narrow enough to prevent the feet getting caught in the mesh.
There are good commercial meshes available in Europe. These measure, for example, 25 x 13 mm, 76 x 13 mm or 19 x 19 mm. To avoid injury to the rabbits' feet the wire is welded and then galvanized. Plastic mesh is impractical because no plastic material can withstand the animals' gnawing.
Various kinds of slats have been tried: wood, bamboo, plastic and metal, but the individual slats of the structure have to be spaced about 1.3-1.5 cm apart so droppings can fall through. Problems of comfort (slippery slats) and hygiene (materials which cannot be disinfected) are unfortunately very common. Wherever possible, wire mesh is preferable to slats.
Only lightweight, calm animals or specially selected breeds (New Zealand White, Californian) can be raised entirely on wire-mesh floors. Producers often compromise by raising the male and female breeding animals on litter and the fattening stock on mesh floors. The breeding animals of heavy breeds can be reared on slatted floors and the young on wire mesh; but slatted floors must be cleaned more frequently.
The dimensions of the breeding cages using litter in France are shown in Table 48 (floor generally of wire mesh but sometimes of metal or plastic slats). As may be seen by comparing these figures with the dimensions given earlier for cages using litter, the mesh floor makes it possible to reduce the area of the breeding cages. At the same time the animal density per square metre (fattening animals) can be increased to 16 on a mesh floor compared to 10 on litter. This is because excrement is immediately eliminated, cutting the risk of parasite contamination. Densities exceeding 16 rabbits per m2 reduce growth (Table 49).

* Cage systems
Cage systems vary in accessibility, supervision and comfort, as well as in convenience of waste removal. Straw-litter cages will be examined first. These are either single deckers (cages with wooden or plywood framework) or built on several levels (concrete cages, with watertight floor beneath straw litter). The principle is generally the same. Access is by a door in the front of the cage, usually made of mesh, or hardwood latticework that must be replaced rather often. The other walls have no openings. They must be built in such a way that the rabbits cannot gnaw them. A rabbit cannot chew on a flat wall but will slowly but surely gnaw away any protruding part of the cage. Some examples of proper wood construction are given in Figure 23. Obviously, softwoods can be gnawed more easily than hardwoods.
Litter removal can be made more efficient if the rear walls of the cages are designed to swing out, as shown in Figure 24. The cages in the illustrations were built for a colony of Angora rabbits (which have to be reared on litter), but can be used by any rabbitry using litter, whether the cages are of concrete, as in Figure 24, or wood.
For cages without litter, mainly cages with wire-mesh floors, the structure is usually made of metal or wood (the latter out of reach of the rabbits' teeth). Walls are usually entirely in wire mesh, but this is not obligatory. There are 4 main systems: flat-deck, Californian, inclined slope battery and compact battery. Figure 25 illustrates these 4 systems. All have been used in European rational production, which means that none is perfect. However, producers prefer the flat-deck system because it has the lowest rabbit density, thus alleviating the problems which arise when many animals are reared in the same building. The main characteristics of each system are described below.
FIGURE 23. -Examples of correct and incorrect assembly of cage, to prevent destruction by rabbits and foster good hygiene
FIGURE 24.-Swinging rear wall in concrete hutch for waste removal (Thebault et al., 1981)
FIGURE 25.-Four systems for using wire cages: (a) flat-deck; (b) Californian; (c) inclined slope battery; and (d) compact battery
Flat-deck:. In this system the cages are all on one level. They usually open at the top. They can be suspended by chains or set on feet or low walls. Floor litter drops into pits (ranging in depth from 20 cm to 1.50 m). Shallow pits are cleared daily or every 2 or 3 days and deep pits every 1 to 3 years. The advantages of the flat-deck system are:
* convenient supervision and handling of animals;
* material used has a long life;
* animal and producer comfort;
* no elaborate ventilation system is required.
The main drawback of the system is the low animal concentration per square metre of building, which increases the investment per animal housed despite the low-cost cages. However, flat-decks are recommended for nurseries. They could also be used for fattening animals, but at a higher investment cost per cage.
California cage. In this system the cages are staggered, one deck higher than the other but not above it. The cages on the lower level open at the top and those on the upper level at the front (poorer access). Floor litter drops beneath the cages and is collected as in the flat-deck system. Advantages of the California system are:
* same advantages as the flat-deck with regard to ventilation;
* slight increase in animal density per square metre of building.
Drawbacks:
* access to upper cages and supervision difficult;
* frame is more expensive than flat-deck.
Inclined slope buttery. The cages are placed one above the other. Waste slides down asbestos or metal panels into troughs from which it is removed manually with scrapers, or with running water. Cages obviously open at the front. Advantages of the inclined slope are:
* higher animal density;
* reasonable cost, though more expensive than flat-deck.
Drawbacks:
* no matter what material is used for the panels or how steeply they slant, waste does not drop properly and must be periodically raked down;
* high animal density demands careful ventilation;
* access to the cages, as well as supervision and handling of the animals are more difficult.
Compact batteries. Waste can be removed by conveyor belt or vats can be installed beneath the cages and emptied by cable-operated scrapers (manual or electric). As with the inclined slope battery, the cages must open from the front. The advantage of this system is that the maximum density of animals reduces costs per animal housed.
The drawbacks are:
* as for the inclined slope battery regarding ventilation, access to cages, supervision and handling of animals;
* quicker wear and tear on materials;
* with automatic scraping there is the risk of breakdown, and harmful gases from the scrapers;
* poor distribution of light for breeding does.
WATERING
A permanent dispenser of clean water is an essential item in each cage, wherever rabbits are not fed green forage alone. Using old cans or glass or earthenware pots as drinkers can create a hygiene problem. Rabbits tend to soil their water, especially if they are reared on straw litter. The drinkers should be fastened so that the rabbits cannot overturn them and so that the breeder can easily clean and refill them once or twice a day.
One possible improvement is an inverted water-bottle drinker. A bottle is inverted over a small trough (Figure 26), which is small enough to restrict pollution. The bottle is big so that it needs to be refilled less often and the breeder can see at a glance whether the animals' water intake is normal.
The best solution is an automatic drinker in every cage (Figure 27). The open drinker guarantees that the rabbits will be watered but it is expensive and there is a high risk of water pollution. A nipple drinker requires some learning on the part of the rabbits and wastes water. Even if there is no leak, the rabbits do not drink all the water that drips out. This can then wet litter or waste. The cost, however, is usually half that of an automatic open drinker. Above all, it ensures that the rabbits will always have clean water. A nipple drinker is the only kind that can be used if the rabbits are fed meal.
FIGURE 26.-Example of inverted water-bottle drinker
Automatic drinkers are fed by water from a low-pressure tank 50-150 cm above cage level. This tank can be used to administer medicine with the water. It is usually filled either by water under pressure (automatic watering) or manually (semi-automatic watering). The tank must be in the shade so that the water will not heat, which would be bad for the rabbits.
FEED TROUGHS AND RACKS
Cages should be fitted with troughs (feed hoppers for grain or pellets, small troughs for feed mashes) or forage racks, or both, depending on how the rabbits are to be fed. Troughs must be easy to clean and disinfect, so they should be detachable.
Figure 28 shows a hopper for grain or pelleted feed. Troughs and racks should be easy to fill from outside the cage without having to open the access door, but the feed must be protected from bad weather and predators. The racks should hold at least I day's ration. the hoppers enough for 2-3 days, and the mash troughs a single ration.
The bars of the rack should be strong enough to withstand the rabbits teeth and keep out the young rabbits. They love to lie on the forage, but they soil it. The feed hopper should also have a trap to keep the young out. The width between partitions in the feed box should be about 7-8 cm for medium breeds. The bars of the racks can be more closely spaced (12 cm) to prevent waste.
FIGURE 27.-Examples of automatic drinkers
FIGURE 28.-Feed hopper
THE NEST BOX
The nest box should be considered one of the most important items of equipment in rabbit production. It directly affects the viability of the young in the pre-weaning stage, which is the high-risk mortality period (15-40 percent of liveborn rabbits). The job of the nesting box is to reproduce conditions in the burrow of a wild doe and protect the young against attacks from the outside environment so that they can get through the first few difficult days of life in optimal comfort. To do this the nest box must:
* allow the doe to kindle and nurse her young in comfort;
* keep the young in a healthy, clean environment:
* keep the young together in cold weather and help them maintain a constant temperature close to 30-35°C in the middle of the nest;
* in hot weather, allow the doe to scatter the nest so that the young can adapt to the temperature;
* keep the young from leaving the nest too early and make it easy for them to get back if they do get out;
* prevent dampness from the animals' urine;
* allow the producer to monitor the litter, remove any dead animals, introduce baby rabbits to be fostered, and change bedding material easily, without disturbing the doe and the young.
FIGURE 29.-Design for a nest box. In hot climates the top of the box can he made of wire mesh
The nest box is strongly advised for rabbitries using straw litter; it is essential in modern production. The box most recommended to meet these requirements, especially the doe's comfort when kindling and nursing, is a rectangular parallelepiped at least 50 x 25 x 25 cm. If there is a dividing panel to keep the young together, at least 30 x 30 cm must be left on that side so that the mother can nurse them in comfort (Figure 29).
The nest box should be made from materials that are impossible to gnaw, easy to disinfect, insulating, and resistant to moisture. In a well-heated rabbitry or a warm climate, galvanized iron can be used if some other material such as plywood, wood or plastic is used for the bottom. Untreated wood, fibreboard, plywood or plastic are frequently used in Europe. They insulate better than metals, but except for plastic are not always easy to disinfect.
A new type of nest box made of wire mesh with a swinging bottom is now in use in France. It works well and simplifies inspection of the litter. It is also easy to clean and disinfect. It does, however, demand a perfectly controlled environment because the young are exposed.
To comply with the habits of the doe and her young, and to make the breeder's work easier, the box should have the following features:
* the bottom should be hollowed so that the young can huddle together when the temperature drops, but it should also favour their dispersion when the temperature rises;
* the bottom should be nonskid' to prevent dislocation of the young bones;
* access for the doe should be opposite the section holding the young so that she will not crush them when entering the nest box suddenly;
* the access hole for the dam should be restricted, square or round, about 15 cm across;
* the bottom of the box should be designed to allow urine to run off. It can he perforated or a space 1-1.5 cm wide can be left between the floor and the sides of the box. Another alternative is straw sandwiched between two layers of mesh;
* the bottom should be detachable so that the whole interior of the box can be cleaned;
* the top should have a trapdoor so that the breeder can easily observe and check the rabbits;
* there should be a sufficiently high ledge, level with the doe's access hole, to keep the young from leaving the box too early (before day 15). An even better solution is to install the box below the level of the cage floor so that the babies can get back in easily.
The doe needs materials in addition to her own fur to make a good nest. Clean straw or soft, untreated wood chips are suitable, and dried grasses can be used. Cellulose cottonwool must never be used.
The nest box can be placed inside or outside the cage. If it is outside it can he fastened to the side of the cage or preferably to the front, to make inspection easier.

Buildings
IN TEMPERATE CLIMATES
In countries with temperate or cool climates, rabbits are reared in buildings that are more or less closed in order to ensure year-round production. Traditional rabbit production in Europe and North America used to be out of doors in hutches, and the animals stopped breeding from the end of summer until early spring. More regular or even nonstop production has been made possible by putting the cages inside.
Temperature and lighting can be controlled to suit the animals. Now the use of wire-mesh cages makes the rabbits more susceptible to the temperature and air flow in their environment, and these cannot really be controlled fully except inside a building. More and more, therefore, European rabbits are being reared in wire-mesh cages inside closed buildings, with controlled ventilation, artificial lighting, winter heating and possibly summer cooling. Such solutions are costly and the producer needs substantial initial capital to house all his animals.
In France, for example, the total outlay (building, caging, other equipment) is figured in terms of the "mother-cage". This reference unit corresponds to the total investment necessary for housing does, bucks, fattening young and future breeders, divided by the number of does. In France the outlay per mother-cage corresponds to the value of the young rabbits produced by the mother-cage in about 18 months.
Technically speaking, the buildings are like those used for battery chickens, with similar insulation, heating, ventilation and lighting. The standards for rabbit production, described at the beginning of this chapter, are, of course, different, but for the rest the rabbit breeder can make convenient use of descriptions of buildings designed for chickens. The many instances of old stables, barns and similar buildings being converted for rabbitries is worth mentioning. Some work is usually needed-sometimes insulation, nearly always ventilation, even for flat-deck systems. Unlike compact batteries, the flat-deck system does not need a very long building, and can therefore usually be installed in any existing construction.
IN VARIABLE HOT CLIMATES
In such climates the rabbits must be reared either on litter in hutches out in the open, or in cages placed inside a building which will serve as a buffer against the heat. Very satisfactory results have been obtained in Burkina Faso with buildings constructed with local materials: laterite bricks, frame made from a hardwood such as palmyra (Borassus arthiopium), and a straw roof. The temperature in a building like this is more constant than in a more costly one made with concrete perpend.
At the Irapuato National Rabbit Centre in Mexico, solid buildings are generally left open in the front during the day and at night the shutters are closed to offset the drop in outside temperature. A daily temperature range of 20°C is common in the region. These shutters also make it possible to ventilate the interior during the daytime; they can be opened to suit the wind direction and regulated to respect the air flow standards mentioned at the start of this chapter.
In some dry tropical regions of Africa where wood is scarce, producers have made satisfactory housing by building small round huts of unbacked earth bricks covered with straw, used for both cage and housing. Litter changing is often quite a problem with this sort of construction, however. The floor should slope slightly and be well off the ground. Parasitism can be partially controlled by demolishing the hut every year and rebuilding it a few metres away. Such housing is thus only suitable for backyard rabbitries in which labour is not a problem.
IN CONSTANT HOT CLIMATES
In countries where the climate is hot but fairly constant (mean minima and maxima between 20 and 30°C) closed buildings are not really necessary. All that is needed is to protect the rabbits against the weather. If the cages are of wood or concrete (solid walls) it may be enough to roof each hutch, as shown in Figure 30. A roof should keep off rain and also heat from direct sunlight. The hutches can also be placed under trees big enough to shade them all day long. A roof should overhang enough to keep water out on rainy' windy days. The hutches should be placed facing away from the prevailing winds.
Wire-mesh cages can be grouped under a common roof. This system, illustrated in Figure 31, was first tried out in California. It is satisfactory provided the roofs overhang far enough at the sides to protect the animals properly. A hedge or fence around the roof structure is useful in protecting the rabbits from strong winds, and from predators.
PREDATORS
The problem of predators differs greatly from region to region. The first step is to build cages sturdy enough to withstand the rabbits themselves and the numerous dogs and cats found in many villages. The rabbitry should be fenced to keep out children and large predators like dogs. This also helps provide the quiet surroundings that rabbits need. According to needs, the building or complex of cages making up the rabbitry should be fenced with wire netting, a living thorn hedge or sturdy pickets.
Rats, mice and other rodents are also dangerous predators; they attack the young and carry diseases. Any rats in the rabbitry should first be exterminated, then the legs of the cages and the poles holding up the roof can be fitted with tin plates at a height that will prevent rats from climbing them. Wire-mesh or concrete cages are more effective in keeping out rats than are wooden ones.
These pests can sometimes get into the feed racks or hoppers. Where such a risk exists the openings of these accessories have to be protected too, because a mother rabbit does not usually guard her young as a dog or even a mother rat would do. Snake control, in countries where this is a problem, is a far more difficult matter. Breeders get used to paying a certain toll to snakes. Fortunately, this is a small percentage of the rabbits.

Apart from the danger of predators, the risk of escape must also be considered. If the cages and buildings are not properly closed the rabbits can get out: either during handling operations or if the rabbitry is attacked by dogs or other large animals. A well-made outer fence usually ensures that the escaped rabbits can be recaptured quickly. If they do get away, they may well be irremediably lost.
There is no risk that escaped domestic rabbits will adapt to living wild and multiply, as they did in Australia and New Zealand. In almost every other country, escaped domestic rabbits have been unable to adapt to the wild. There are numerous predators of animals the size of rabbits (dog and cat families, birds of prey). which soon destroy them. The only risk is on certain islands where potential predators do not already exist, as was the case in Australia in the last century.
Uses for waste
In every type of rabbit production unit the producer has to remove the excrement and waste from the rabbitry (straw litter and droppings which pile up under cages). These can be put to good use on the farm. The amounts and composition of waste, however. vary according to housing and feeding conditions.

Rabbits eating balanced concentrate feeds and raised on mesh floors produce about 250-400 g of faeces and 0.5-0.8 litre of urine per mother cage a day, depending on how intensive production is. This waste is much richer in fertilizing elements than average farm manure (Table 50). In fact, farm manure contains only 0.4-0.6 percent of each of the major fertilizer components-N, P[2]O[5 ]and K[2]O.
The composition of the waste varies with the type of rabbit (Table 51). A comparison of the figures in Tables 50 and 51 shows that there is a greater risk of nitrogen and phosphorus losses during storage than of the other elements.
The average composition of the manure produced by animals reared on litter depends partly on the kind of feed but mostly on the kind and amount of litter used. If well preserved, the waste collected weekly will contain the fertilizing elements in the faeces and part of those in the urine, plus those in the litter. Fertilizer 'production" is therefore at least equal to that in a rabbitry not using litter.

7. Rabbitry management
The production cycle
Organizing a rabbitry
Questions of management are discussed in various parts of this book. This chapter brings these different aspects together. The technical and economic criteria presented apply primarily to rational rabbitries of a certain size (at least 50 does). The rules of technical management are the same for smaller units, but the economic variables are different. The objective of small-scale units is not to make the greatest possible profit, but to achieve satisfactory productivity with a low input system using local resources and family labour.
The production cycle
As ovulation in does is provoked by mating, and the females are generally kept in different cages from the males, it is the breeder who determines the reproduction rate of the unit. These rates vary from 1 or 2 litters a year under the most extensive management to 8-10 litters in an intensive management system. In rational European rabbitries does are remated either immediately after kindling (intensive system) or about 10 days later (semi-intensive). European backyard rabbitries use a more extensive system, presenting the doe to the buck 1-2 months after kindling. Young does are first presented for mating at 4-7 months, depending on the breed (lighter breeds are usually more precocious) and especially on the diet.
In the semi-intensive system illustrated in Figure 32, the does are first presented to the buck at 41/2 months. They are then mated 10-12 days after the birth of each litter. Weaning (separation of doe and young) takes place at 28-30 days. Many European breeders (France, Italy, Spain) manage intensively: mating does within 48 hours of kindling and weaning the young at 26-28 days. This, however, requires very good feeding and a producer with a fairly high level of expertise.
Extensive systems are characterized by a long delay between kindling and mating, and perhaps even until weaning. For example, the young may be weaned at 56 days and the doe mated after weaning. This system is still practiced in France in farm rabbitries, where breeding does are fed fodder and grain.
FIGURE 32.-Production cycle of the domestic rabbit
At weaning the young are separated from the doe. The duration of fattening varies, depending on the carcass weight required and the growth rate possible in the feeding and production conditions of the rabbitry.
In intensive European production, where weaning takes place at 1 month, the fattening period is 7 weeks. The rabbits weigh 2.3-2.4 kg (liveweight) when they are ready for the market. Some African breeding units where weaning takes place at 2 months are reported to need a 4-month fattening period, because balanced concentrates are not available. European and North American countries which market rabbits at liveweights of 1.7-1.8 kg use a different system. The young are not weaned. They are left with their doe up to the age of 2 months, when they are sold. The mother is remated 3 weeks before that. This latter system can produce 5-6 litters a year.
REPRODUCTION
* Mating
Servicing is always done in the buck's cage. The breeder checks the doe's health at this time to make sure she has no respiratory disorder, sore hocks, etc. or that she is not too thin. A red vulva is a promising but not infallible sign (80-90 percent chance of mating success). A buck can fertilize a doe with a white vulva (10-20 percent chance of success). When the doe has accepted mounting and the buck has serviced her the breeder removes the doe and puts her back in her own cage. Altogether this should not take more than 5 minutes.
While the doe is being handled the producer can carry out any treatment necessary-anti-mange, for example. If the doe refuses to mate,the breeder can try to present her to another buck. As a last resort he can leave her for 24 hours in the buck's cage but then he cannot be sure that mating has taken place. It is better to mate the animals in the morning or evening, to avoid the hottest hours of the day.
In intensive breeding 1 buck can serve 7 or 8 does. In the extensive system 1 buck can serve 10-15 does. The buck, however, should not be used more than 3 or 4 days a week, and not more than 2 or 3 times a day. So even if there are only, say, 10 does in the unit, there should be at least 2 bucks so that successful mating is not dependent on 1 buck alone. When the size of the unit permits (at least 50 does), 1-2 reserve bucks are kept. If a balanced pelleted feed is used the bucks should be fed from 120 to 180 g a day, depending on their weight.
The first mating of medium-size, properly fed does takes place around 4 months. Bucks are first mated at about 5 months. If production conditions are not optimum the first mating will be delayed until the animals reach 80 percent of their adult weight. There is no advantage in delaying it further. The breeder should carefully supervise the first mating. For the first month the young buck should not be mated as often as an adult.
* Determining pregnancy
The only effective way of determining pregnancy is to detect the embryos in the doe's uterus by palpating the abdomen. This operation should be carried out between 10 and 14 days after mating. It is not effective if performed earlier (before the 9th day), while after the 14th day the operation is more delicate and there is a risk of provoking abortion. The breeder must palpate the doe gently and expertly in order not to cause an abortion.
If palpation shows the doe to be empty she is presented to the buck again as soon as possible. Presentation of the doe to the buck as a test of pregnancy is pointless, though not dangerous. Indeed a large proportion of pregnant does accept mating and some empty does refuse. Nor is doe liveweight an indication of pregnancy because weight fluctuations depend on too many factors.
Preparations for kindling (supervision, nest box, changing bedding material, etc) should be made for all the mated does from the 27th to the 28th day after mating if they have not been palpated' but where palpation has been practiced regularly the preparations are restricted to the does found to be pregnant.
A pregnant doe that is not nursing a litter will be rationed if the breeder uses balanced concentrates. The daily ration for medium-size does will be about 150 g. If the doe is nursing a litter at the same time she will be fed ad lib.
* Kindling
Kindling should take place in quiet, hygienic surroundings. The breeder's presence is not required, but the nests should be checked as soon as possible after kindling. This operation is easy and there is no risk to the young. It can be performed right after kindling, provided the mother is removed. The breeder should remove any dead animals, and any foetal sacs the doe has not eaten.
A nursing doe needs considerable nutrition and from the time of parturition she should be fed ad lib. Drinking water is very important in the days leading up to and following parturition. The doe will nurse her young once a day, usually in the early morning.
The mortality rate between birth and weaning is still high (20 percent today in European rabbitries). A mortality figure of less than 12 percent is very difficult to achieve. Therefore the nests have to be inspected daily and any dead animals removed. Strict preventive hygiene is more important than ever at this period.
* Fostering
The breeder may decide it is necessary to eliminate excess newborn rabbits in a large litter. or they may be fostered to a smaller litter, if certain rules are respected:
* no more than 3 young rabbits should be given to a foster mother;
* the maximum age difference between the foster doe's litter and the fostered young should be 48 hours;
* fostering should take place within 5 days of kindling.
* Weaning
During the weaning period the young gradually give up milk for solid feed. Weaning is also the time when the breeder separates the young from the doe. All the young of a litter are taken away at the same time and placed 6-8 per cage in the area set aside for fattening. The cages must be clean and the groups should be fairly uniform , with a maximum age difference of 1 week between them. During the transfer operation the breeder checks the health of the young rabbits culling any that are undersized or sick.
Weaning can take place when the rabbit's liveweight tops 500 g (after approximately 26-30 days in rational European production). The young rabbits begin to eat solid feed at 18-20 days, and when they reach 30 days the doe's milk provides no more than 20 percent of the daily feed intake.
* Stock reduction and renewal of breeding does
One of the apparent drawbacks of intensive reproduction is the rapid turnover of breeding stock. Monthly culling rates of 8-10 percent are not uncommon. In fact, where reproduction is intensive the breeder soon learns the value of each doe and can thus keep the best. The total number of rabbits produced by each doe during her working life is fairly independent of the rate of reproduction imposed by the breeder. Whatever the reproduction and the monthly stock renewal rates, to avoid having empty cages in the nursery there should be a constant reserve of does available that are ready for mating.
The breeder has several means of renewing breeding does. The most practical solution, applicable to both pure breeds and °Common" strains, is to select the best young from the best does. To avoid inbreeding, the bucks and even the does should be obtained from another breeder (selector). If production is intensive, the producer can buy breeding animals from a selection programme of specialized strains for crossbreeding-the system of stock renewal to follow will be advised by the supplier.
FATTENING AND SLAUGHTER
During the weaning-to-slaughter growth period the rabbit should always be fed ad lib. If the breeder uses balanced concentrates, the average daily consumption will be 100-130 g for medium-size animals. In good conditions the rabbits will gain 3(1-40 g a day, which means an intake of 33.5 kg feed will produce a I kg gain in liveweight. Young fattening rabbits can also be fed cereals and fodder, with or without the supplement of a suitable concentrate.
During this period mortality should be very low-only a traction of the fattening stock-but it is often far higher. Preventive hygiene (cleaning, disinfecting) is essential in the fattening station, but the breeder will often pay less attention to this area than he will to the nursery.
The animals are sold alive or as carcasses. Rabbits raised in rational production systems are sold at about 70-90 days at weights of 2.3-2.5 kg for strains like the New Zealand White and Californian. In extensive production systems with less-well-balanced feeding the rabbits may be sold much later (4 to 6 months, maximum). Fattening animals that have passed the usual age for sale can form a reserve from which the breeder can draw for home consumption or stock renewal. In farm rabbitries, the mortality risk from accidents, epidemics and so forth is still high, and any delay in the regular slaughtering age for whatever reason, such as keeping the rabbits alive for gradual home consumption, can end in catastrophe, with the death of all the animals. The higher the mortality rate during fattening, the more the breeder will tend to shorten the length of this production phase.
If rabbits are to be kept beyond 3 months the bucks must be either put in individual cages or castrated, so that they can continue to be colony reared. The females may remain in groups, but will need more cage space than they did before 3 months. Castration is a simple operation, though it usually requires 2 people (Figure 33).
The breeder may wish to slaughter his animals himself. The necessary installations are relatively expensive if the proper standards of hygiene and conservation (cold storage, etc) are to be respected. He will also need labour for a few hours a week to help with the slaughter.
FIGURE 33.-Castration of young male rabbit (Lissot 1974)
HANDLING RABBITS
Rabbits should be handled gently. They must never be lifted by their ears. Several techniques can be used to pick them up and hold them.
A rabbit can always be picked up by the skin of the shoulders (Figure 34). For animals weighing under 1 kg, one method is to pick them up and carry them by the saddle just above the hindquarters, using thumb and index finger (Figure 35). If the animals are heavier it is best to take them by the skin of the shoulders, but if they have to be transported or shifted for more than 5 or 10 seconds they must either be supported with the other hand (Figure 36) or be carried on the forearm with the head in the bend of the elbow (Figure 37).
If an animal struggles and the producer feels he cannot control it, it is best to just drop it so it will fall on all fours, and then pick it up again correctly within 2-3 seconds. If the breeder keeps his hold on a struggling rabbit he risks some nastry scratches, and can even break the rabbit's backbone.
Organizing a rabbitry
FIRST OPERATION IDENTIFICATION
Identification can be made in 2 ways: by individuals and by cages. The first method is necessary for all producers who intend to select. The second is important for the economic management of the rabbitry.
* Individual identification
Each animal is assigned a number. This number will appear on all documents concerning the rabbit and on the rabbit itself. There are 3 main ways of identifying rabbits on a lasting basis. Not all are equally good.
* rings: a numbered ring is attached to the hind leg just above the hock. Risk of losing the ring is high;
* clips: numbered clips are attached to the rabbits' ears. These clips are made of metal or plastic, and risk of loss is again high;
* tattooing: small holes are punched in the rabbit's ear spelling out numbers or letters, and these are filled by rubbing in a special ink. A well-made tattoo lasts throughout the rabbit's lifetime. Although this method takes longer, it is the only one that is really sure. It can be done at weaning using special rabbit pincers, or on adult rabbits with sheep pincers (Figure 38).

FIGURE 38.-Using a clipper with movable numbers to tattoo the identification number on a rabbit's ear (1 = operator's hands, 2 = assistant's hand)
* Cage identification
The management unit of a rabbitry is the mother-cage. All the cages in the nursery section should be numbered, and this is the figure that will appear on the records. This method is much easier than individual identification, so it is used in rabbitries which keep records but do not breed selectively.
An identification system is essential even in small rabbitries. It will form the basis of the technical records that will serve for both the organization of the work and the economic management of the rabbitry.
FIGURE 39.-Example of a doe card.
FIGURE 40.-Example of a buck card. M = mating, P = outcome of palpation, NL = number of rabbits born live
TECHNICAL RECORDS AND ORGANIZATION OF WORK
* In the nursery
This unit will occupy most of the producer's attention.
A daily record book is essential in almost every kind of production. The producer notes the chief operations simply and clearly:
* mating days for each doe, indicating sire (used to check buck fertility);
* outcome of palpation, where performed;
* numerical size of each litter at birth;
* numerical size of each litter at weaning.
The young does selected for replacement are identified at weaning.
This list is far from complete. Litter weight at weaning could be added, for instance. If the producer uses balanced concentrates he will enter the amounts fed in the nursery to compute the average feeding cost per weaned rabbit. This is an important item in calculating net profit. A similar entry would be equally helpful for other types of feeding, but these are far more difficult to estimate.
The record book system is often inadequate. One improvement is a doe card hooked to each cage, for calculating individual doe productivity. The example shown in Figure 39 summarizes the items of information just listed. Another useful addition is a buck card (Figure 40).
The next step is to put the data together to get an overview of the unit for efficient organization of the work. This is essential in any rabbitry with more than a few dozen does.
Planning pigeonholes (Figure 41) offer a virtually foolproof way of monitoring all events in the nursery. Assuming that does are remated and litters are weaned no later than 1 month after kindling, the system involves a large box with 4 horizontal rows of 31 compartments. Each corresponds to a day of the month. The first row is for matings, the second for pregnancy checks (palpation), the third for births and the last for weanings. If weaning takes place between 1 and 2 months, which is common in extensive production, there will be 2 rows for weaning, for even months and odd months.
FIGURE 41.-Diagram of planning pigeonholes (see text for explanation of card movement)
Every morning the producer sees in his work book what operations are to be carried out. As each is completed, the card of the doe concerned is moved into the pigeonhole corresponding to the next operation and the day for which it is scheduled.
In a rabbitry where mating takes place 10 days after kindling and rabbits are weaned at 35 days, the doe record could be as follows: Let us suppose the doe is mated on the third day of an odd month. Her card is then placed in the palpation row. This operation is performed on the 16th of the same month ( + 13 days). If the result is positive, the doe card is placed in the kindling row under the second day of the following month (+ 15 days). If it is negative, her card will go back to the mating row. After kindling the doe card returns to the mating row under the 1 2th day of the same month ( + 10 days). At the same time, a card with the doe's individual and cage numbers will be placed in the weaning row, in space , of the second, odd month (+35 days).
There are other planning systems. The important thing is to use one system consistently.
Scheduling several matings, a few palpations and the weaning of several litters all for the same day adds up to a lot of wasted time. Using a weekly work plan I man working 8 hours a day can manage 250-300 does. Table 52 is an example of such a work plan. Scheduled matings (Thursdays and especially Fridays) mean other activities can be grouped (weaning on Tuesdays, palpation on Wednesdays). Some activities such as nest supervision and feeding have to be carried out every day.
With this method batches of litters at weaning are close to the same age. It also sets the time for activities the producer always tends to postpone, such as recording data and carrying out preventive hygiene measures.
In a rational production unit the following average times must be set aside for the main nursery activities for 100 does:
mating: 4 hours a week;
* nest supervision: 3 hours a week;
* handling young, nest boxes: 2 hours a week;
* palpation: 1 hour a week;
* hygiene: 4 hours a week.

* Fattening records
Here again the daily record book is essential. It will list the first and last fattening days (sale or slaughter) of the animals in each cage, any mortality and the apparent causes. Liveweight when sold and the number of animals marketed weekly could also be added. In large-scale production, production checks will be done by batches (a batch is a group of rabbits weaned the same week). The batch will be the core reference point of all technical data.
If the breeder uses balanced concentrates he will record the amount of feed eaten by fattening rabbits. Feed conversion efficiency (the amount of feed needed to produce a weight gain of I kg) is a sound economic criterion. If the producer wants to breed his stock selectively he can use a litter card listing the weaning weight and date, the weight and date at sale or slaughter, and the individual identification number of each rabbit.

* Some production targets
Table 53 contains the findings of a sample study made in 100 rational French production units. The production units used for estimating the average of the 9 best or 9 poorest performances for the different criteria listed are not necessarily the same.
The basic technical criterion in the nursery is the number of young weaned per doe per year. Economically, the tendency is to calculate this in terms of the mother-cage and include the amount of feed consumed. The young weaned per doe depend on the number of kindlings a year, the number of young weaned per litter and the real rate of occupancy of the nursery cages.
Several analytical factors are important in the fattening stage- growth rate, feed efficiency, age at slaughter, carcass yield, mortality. Global criteria such as overall feed efficiency (number of kg of feed from birth to slaughter needed to produce 1 kg of rabbit) cover the range of production and feeding activities. The number of rabbits sold per week in reference to a fixed number of does is another global criterion.
To help producers with this work, outside organizations (research or development agencies, private firms) can collect the main technical data of their production units every week and make an estimation of these parameters. With this information a breeder knows what results to expect. A comparison with other rabbit production units will reveal any weak points in his system.
ECONOMIC MANAGEMENT
As with keeping technical records, not all producers have the same needs in economic management, which mainly concerns those whose purpose is to make a good profit.
There is a great deal of variation in this area. Results depend on the expertise of the breeder and his economic situation, so there is not much point in giving absolute figures. Table 54 shows the relative importance of the various items on a French breeder's cost schedule. He is an average producer who started a year ago with 100 breeding does in a new building. His investment per mother-cage is sizeable but not excessive. His productivity level is 46 young rabbits marketed per mother-cage per year at 2.4 kg. The overall feed efficiency index is 4. His does are hybrid breeding animals. The annual culling rate is 80 percent. The ratio between the sale price of 1 kg of live rabbit and the cost price of the feed is 8 to 1.

Note: These results relate to French conditions. The various factors are interlinked and cannot, therefore, he added. Figures are indicative.
Operating costs, which can vary with the production system, here amount to more than 70 percent of the cost of production. Feed is the main item under this heading (65 percent of the total outlay). This is why feed efficiency is so important. Depreciation of the building and equipment together with financial charges amount to more than 25 percent of the total. These figures are closely linked with the French socioeconomic situation. As always, the higher the level of investment the greater the unit's productivity must be to write off these debts.
Table 55 looks at the influence of various production factors on income. The same 100-doe unit mentioned above was used for this study. The findings are indicative and valid in French conditions for production levels close to those in Table 53. Among the financial factors, sensitivity to sale prices for rabbit meat is very high. In these circumstances it is easy to see the advantage of direct sales.
Improvement in overall production has a substantial impact on producer income. Feed consumption is here again of considerable importance.

8. Production of rabbit skins and angora wool
The production cycle
Organizing a rabbitry
The objective in raising rabbits is meat production. The exceptions are rabbits raised for their fur only-a rare exception this (only the Rex rabbit at present, and in very small numbers)-and the Angora rabbit for textile wool.
The outcome is that the rabbit pelt (as with all slaughter animals) is a byproduct, imposing no special constraints on meat production methods. But wool is the main target of Angora rabbit production and the need to produce a quality fur has led Angora breeders to develop methods quite different from those used in meat rabbit production.
These two production systems should therefore be dealt with separately because of their different natures, destinations, markets and production techniques. There is only one point they have in common: hair shorn from lower-grade skins that cannot be used in fur manufacture is partly used by the textile industry.
Rabbit skins
Rabbit fur production is not comparable with the production of other fur species. Mink, which tops the list of species bred essentially for their fur, supplies a world total of about 25 million pelts a year. In France alone annual rabbit skin production tops the 70 million mark. But mink is bred for its fur and rabbits for meat, so rabbit fur is just a byproduct to which breeders give scant attention.
Intensive meat rabbit production techniques in Europe are usually incompatible with production standards for quality fur pelts. In fact, the raw skin represents only a small percentage of the value of the living animal. So more and more frequently rabbits are slaughtered at an age or time of year when their coats have not fully developed. This is usually at 10-12 weeks when they still have an infant coat or are beginning the sub-adult moult. These thin, unstable coats are not suitable for furs.
The only season when the adult coat is stable and homogeneous is winter. This is true of any animal over 5 months of age. The rest of the year there are always moult areas of greater or lesser size, so the coat is uneven and the hair is not firmly attached to the skin. Some summer coats can be homogeneous, especially those of rabbits that have completed the sub-adult moult, but the rabbits must be at least 5 months old. The summer coat is also thinner than the winter coat.
This rather inflexible growth cycle and seasonal changes in the coat create the problem of simultaneous fur and meat production. Fur can therefore only constitute a byproduct, especially in intensive production. However, no research has been done on moulting patterns in hot climates; the figures given here only really apply to temperate regions. In extensive production, rabbits are slaughtered at 4-6 months, and this is the situation in many tropical countries. So quality skins could be produced in the tropics assuming the proper skinning and preserving techniques were used.
SORTING AND GRADING PELTS
In an unsorted batch of rabbit skins valuable pelts can be found side by side with useless waste, so sorting and grading should be done as early as possible. Sorting is the first operation and determines the future use of the skin. Skins are sorted into 3 grades.
1: Pelts for dressing (the term "dressing" instead of "tanning" is used for fur). These are the best skins, with regular shape, intact, homogeneous, dense, a well-formed coat, a flawless skin. Their price may be 20 times that of ordinary-quality skins.
2: Pelts for shorn hair. These usually lack the proper shape or are not homogeneous enough for fur products. The hair, however, is sufficiently long and healthy. It is therefore machine shorn and used for textiles or felting (though the millinery trade is declining in many countries). The skin is cut into fine strips (vermicelli) and made into glue (another declining industry) or fertilizer. This technique allows much of the pelt to be recycled.
3: Waste, unusable except for fertilizer (the hair is gnawed, cut, soiled, sweaty, parasite-ridden). These skins push up the costs of labour, processing and transport.
In France, one of the foremost rabbit producing countries, the proportion of pelts suitable for dressing is less than a half of those collected.
The figure differs from one author to another, which is not surprising in view of the difficulty in getting exact data on this product.
The customer buys the skins in commercial lots (from 0.5 to 5 tonnes) of matching quality. The following grading system is used in France (and also in many other countries because of the number of French traders in the fur market). For pelts for shorn hair: rejects-hair weight 10-18 percent of the dry pelt weight; ordinary-hair weight more than 18 percent of dry pelt weight; good quality, with guard hair removed-for glovemaking. For fur pelts:
Grading is more complex for fur pelts, as colour, size and quality are all considered. The colours are white, range of grey, range of red (nankin), mixed and black.
Size is assessed by the weight per 100 dry pelts:
entre-deux: 12-13 kg/100 pelts (100-140 g per pelt);
cage: 13-20 kg/100 pelts (150-210 g per pelt);
heavy: 26-40 kg/100 pelts (250-350 g per pelt).
The gap between grades and the difference between weight per IOU pelts and unit weight stem from fluctuations in assessment.
Quality assessment covers the integrity of the pelt (proper cut, good fleshing, no knife marks or holes from skinning) and its structure (height of guard hair, compactness and height of downy undercoat and the homogeneity of the coat):
pelts 4: poorest;
pelts 3, 2 bis: medium;
pelts 2 and 1: best.
This classification, which at first sight looks complex, is in actual fact relatively simple: traders and clients know exactly what merchandise is in question when they speak of a °Cage 2 grey" or an "entre-deux 4 nankin".
The system, with slight variations, is the same in every country, understandably so considering rabbit pelts are an international trade item. In the United States, where rabbit production is not widespread and is undertaken by amateurs, US Department of Agriculture grades are (US Dept Agric, 1959):
* firsts: no defects, thick and regular sub-hair. Used for furs;
* seconds: some hair defects and a certain lack of thickness, short sub
* hair. For inferior fur and cutting;
* thirds: for cutting (felt) or toys;
* hatters: rejects, the best of which are used for cutting.
Firsts and seconds include 5 colours: white (price sometimes double that of colours as they can be dyed); red; blue; chinchilla; mixed.
Sorting and grading clearly show that it is in the interest of the breeder and the general economy of the country to produce the highest possible proportion of quality pelts or at least reduce the proportion of those which are unusable. It is also important to be able to constitute homogeneous commercial lots. This means that if production is low in a region the range of colours should be limited. The choice is not simple, given the ups and downs of fashion. The wisest choice would normally be white, as it generally commands a good price and once dyed can easily follow colour fashion trends. However, this is not the best advice at present' with longhaired fur in vogue and dyeing virtually in disuse.
THE PRODUCTION OF QUALITY PELTS
* Moulting
The main barrier to quality pelt production is slaughter age: the pelt must be big enough, and the whole coat mature. The crucial times are moulting-juvenile moults for growing rabbits and seasonal moults for adults.
The seasonal moults in adults are ruled by seasonal photoperiodicity and occur in spring and autumn. The spring moults are spectacular, with visible loss of winter hair, but they are slow and irregular and rarely give an entirely stable coat in summer. This summer coat, thin and short, is not among the most prized-it weighs only 60 g. The autumn moult on the other hand reactivates all the hair follicles in a relatively short time. It gives longer hairs and above all multiplies the secondary hair follicles which produce a part of the undercoat. The winter coat, which remains stable for several months, weighs approximately 90 g. It is this coat which is the most highly prized of all, if not the only one used. In addition, the network of collagen fibres of the derma is contracted, and produces a finer and stronger skin.
It is obviously preferable in a temperate climate to slaughter the animal at the onset of winter, as soon as the coat is mature, to ensure the least possible deterioration of the hair. Unfortunately no detailed study has been made in tropical or equatorial climates.
There are 3 types of juvenile coat: that of the newborn rabbit, infant coats, and sub-adult coats. The first two are unusable because they are too small. The coat of the newborn rabbit stops growing when the animal reaches 0.4 kg (for an average size breed); it weighs only 8-10 g. The infant coat is mature at around 9 weeks and its weight depends on the rabbit's weight, since the number of hair follicles in development depends on the size of the skin area of the growing animal. If a rabbit weighs 0.5 kg at 9 weeks it carries 15 g of hair, against 30 g for a rabbit weighing 1.1 kg. The coat is thus still light in weight and the hair is fine.
The sub-adult coat becomes more interesting but the moult which produces it is long (4-5 weeks) and only begins when the rabbit reaches 1.71.9 kg. It matures at the earliest at 4 to 5 months, usually after 5 months. The weight of the coat, and hence the length of the hair and its density, also depends on the season in which the hair develops: 40 g in summer, 60 g in autumn or in winter, which is acceptable. The sub-adult coat is therefore the first coat that could provide a fur.
It is very difficult to obtain pelts for fur in intensive production systems (slaughter at 11 weeks). However, a breeder might attempt to produce acceptable pelts for shorn hair by using simple measures (animal housing, precautions at slaughter and skinning).
It is not impossible to produce pelts for fur in a rational extensive production system (an extensive system in which production techniques are strictly adhered to, especially with regard to hygiene, habitat and feeding). In fact, with a low investment, not forcing the animals' growth and using an economical but balanced feed regime, it should be possible to slaughter the animals at around 5 months.
* Environment
Sub-adult and adult moults are ruled by seasonal photoperiodicity. They can therefore be induced by artificial lighting, but this calls for sophisticated installations (windowless housing) and the technique is complex (interference with reproduction). At present, natural photoperiodicity seems to offer the greatest security for the production of quality pelts, which argues in favour of rational, extensive production.
Temperature does not influence moults, but it does seem to affect the structure of the coat: a greater number of downy hairs and longer hair in cold zones, and a shorter, thinner coat in hot zones. As a consequence, cold or temperate countries are more likely to provide pelts for fur production.
Rearing rabbits in colonies leads to fighting and possibly trichophagy (the rabbits eat one another's hair for lack of roughage in the diet). Individual cage rearing, at least during the month preceding slaughter, is to be preferred. The cage with straw litter, as will be seen with the
Angora rabbit, gives a completely defect-free and clean coat, but individual mesh cages can also give good results. In this area too, extensive production is more likely to provide pelts for fur production.
A wholesome, balanced diet is required-the question is whether to aim at a rapid growth, or a slightly moderated growth rate using economical rations from the farm's own produce. For fur production, slaughter should be delayed to 5 months, or 41/2 months at the earliest, and this also argues in favour of rational extensive production.
Any physiological imbalance or pathological disorder has immediate repercussions on the coat, even if it has reached maturity. It becomes dull and unkempt, the secretion of the sebaceous glands is disturbed and the rabbit neglects its grooming. A skin collected in this condition will never make a good fur. Normal hygienic procedures, valid whatever the production system, also favour the production of a quality pelt and help to avoid diseases which specifically affect the skin. This will be one of the most difficult problems for developing countries.
* Choice of breed and selection
In making this choice there are two factors above all to be considered with relation to grading pelts: colour and size.
Colour is a question of fashion but, as mentioned earlier, white is the most suitable as it is impervious to fashion changes; it can be dyed. It must be remembered that the trader is interested only in lots of 4 or 5 tonnes. Large pelts are the most prized; without going so far as to produce giant rabbits this means that midget breeds should be set aside.
Lastly there is the structure of the coat: it should be homogeneous, with long hair and a thick undercoat well covered with silky guard hair.
THE COLLECTION, PRESERVATION AND STORAGE OF PELTS
* Skinning
Skinning should be carried out in a manner that ensures the largest possible skin surface, which is an important part of its value. The first cut is usually an incision at the hind feet, passing from one thigh to the other. The skin is then pulled off. The skin on the head is of no commercial value so it can be discarded, which facilitates the drying.
This operation should be done with care to avoid mutilation, knife marks, grease (which oxidizes and burns the skin) or bloodstains. All these defects reduce the value of the pelt, especially when the coat is originally of good quality. The sequence of skinning operations is illustrated in Figure 42.
FIGURE 42.-Skinning a rabbit
Rabbit pelts are preserved only by drying. This is a simple operation which can be done anywhere, and costs little (the salt used to preserve the skins of other species can be expensive). Drying should start immediately after the skin has been removed. It must cool off quickly and dry out to prevent the action of enzymes in the derma which attack the hair root and cause the hair to fall. If fresh pelts are left in a pile for even a short time a rapid bacterial fermentation will set in and cause the hair to fall out in patches. Many pelts are lost this way for a lack of elementary care.
The skins are shaped on a frame. They should not be excessively stretched, not should there be any creases. The frame can be a board, a steel wire frame (Figure 43), or even a fairly supple stem with no branches. Straw should not be used as padding as it can deform the pelt.
During drying, air should circulate freely, and the skins should not come into contact with one another. It is out of the question to accelerate drying by exposing the skins to the sun or to hot air, above 50°C the collagen of the derma is altered irreversibly and the skin cannot be processed. They should be dried in the shade in a well-aired place (optimum temperature 18-22°C, 65 percent relative humidity).
FIGURE 43.-Correct way to dry rabbit pelts
* Storage
The pelts are arranged in piles when they are perfectly dry in a cool airy room, with insecticide (naphthaline) between each layer of skin. It is best to grade the pelts without delay, the grading being more or less elaborate according to the size of the stock in question. At least the different qualities should be separated immediately, and the white skins from the coloured.
Whether the destination of the pelt is fur or hair production, all operations from skinning to storage must be carried out with care and attention. The slightest fault in handling results in a lowering of grade, which is all the more serious when a high-quality skin is involved and all the work carried out previously is lost. The greater the homogeneity and quality of the pelts the more attractive they will be to the trader, which is particularly important at times of market depression.
If it is intended to extend rabbit production in a country for the profitable sale of the pelts, the training required should not be underestimated. It will be needed not only in production, particularly in teaching producers how to recognize the state of maturity, but also in the care needed in skinning the animal and in preserving and storing the pelt. Experience with hides and skins of other species shows the extent of losses due to negligence (in some countries only 1 pelt remains from every 3 animals slaughtered). Perhaps bad habits can more easily be avoided with the introduction of new husbandry methods.
CURING AND GLOSSING
Developing countries are increasingly processing the cattle hides and sheep skins they produce. The first step is to turn out semifinished products, for which the technology is simpler and more uniform, albeit demanding, and for which there is a wider market. Finished leather is a specialized product whose manufacture is far more delicate to undertake as experience and imagination are both essential.
This is why developing countries are holding back their rough pelts to make semifinished products such as wet-blues and hides (India, Pakistan). This system obviously has the advantage of using the local labour available and giving greater value to the exported product.
Is the same development possible for rabbit pelts? This is difficult enough to answer with regard to other fur, which must always be perfect, and even more difficult for rabbit fur, towards which there is some consumer resistance, and because European output, though of medium quality, is so high. On the other hand, shearing the pelt for the hair does not seem to pose any particular problem any more than does the utilization of the remainder of the skin, even if only for fertilizer. There is also the possible manufacture of small objects such as toys with pieces of low-quality fur; however, this is of relatively small economic importance and may involve difficulties with the hygiene regulations of importing countries.
* Curing
Processing the pelt to the semifinished stage requires a series of operations:
* dipping: rehydration of the pelts with water, salt and possibly soap, followed by rinsing;
* fleshing: the rabbit skin has a peculiarity-a thin collagenous film on the flesh side. This membrane, which is impervious to curing products, should be removed. This is a delicate, labour-intensive operation, carried out on the rehydrated skins;
* dressing: the special tanning for rabbit skins generally uses a special blend of salt, alum and formol;
* thinning: it is necessary to thin down the thicker skins. This is highly specialized work, demanding great precision to avoid holes in the skin, cutting hair follicles, causing hair loss. A second dressing is carried out on the thinned skins;
* greasing: nourishing the skin with oil. This operation is labour intensive;
* finishing: this gives the skin a pleasing appearance by removing grease (stirring in a tub with absorbents), beating (tossing in a meshed cylinder to remove absorbents, sawdust, grit, kaolin), lifting the hair to set it in place. Machines can be used for all 3 finishing stages.
* Glossing
This is a complicated finishing operation, with variations such as shaving or colouring according to the final product required. It calls for much handling, expertise and imagination (mixing of dyes, special effects, etc). These operations are too complex to describe here. However, it is often the furrier who, having chosen his lot of rough furs, decides on the final appearance they will be given. For a coat, 20-30 skins will be needed. The making up of "bodies" (remnants of fur sewn together and sold by length), which is labour intensive and not highly automated, can be done in developing countries or in countries where the labour is less expensive (Greece, the Republic of Korea, and, for mink pelts, Taiwan [Province of China]).
* Hair production
It would be mistaken to assume that the pelt for shorn hair is a negligible product. Depending on quality its value can be very high-80F in France in 1978, againt 300F for an Angora pelt. The fluctuations in value, however, are vertiginous because demand is not constant: a pelt for hair can be worth between 1 and 20F according to the quality and the demand of the moment. This figure is multiplied by 5 to arrive at the price of the hair.
The Angora
In the matter of textiles, "angora" without any other qualification refers solely to the hair produced by Angora rabbits.
Its ISO (International Organization for Standardization) symbol is WA: W for wool, reserved for noble textile hair, as opposed to H used for ordinary hair. The letter A is for the Angora rabbit, and distinguishes it from the mohair goat, M (the term Angora goat is no longer used). The symbol for mohair is thus WM. The short hair of the ordinary rabbit is designated HK (K = Kaninchen in German).
Angora hair is unusually long owing to the prolongation of the active phase of the hair follicle cycle: the hair grows for approximately 14 weeks? whereas that of the rabbit with ordinary (short) hair grows at the same rate but for only 5 weeks.
Apart from this great length, there is no other modification either in the hair's structure or in the composition of the coat, which contains the 3 classic types of rabbit hair:
* guide hairs; the longest (12-15 cm) and the roughest; they cover and guide the coat;
* guard hairs ("barbes"); shorter than guide hairs (8-10 cm); their rough points lie on the coat and hermetically seal it (covering hair): 4 to each guide hair;
* down: shortest hair (6 cm); rounded point, hardly visible, very fine body (13.5 ~m). Very numerous, 60 to a guide hair, they constitute the thermic isolation undercoat.
It is the length of angora hair which gives it its textile value as it permits cohesion in the thread.
The rabbit's hair is characterized by an extremely low friction coefficient which is due to the very slight relief of the cuticle scales. This results in a particular softness to the touch, but also an exceptional capacity for slipping. This is why the length of angora is important; the hair is twisted and stays in the thread. The use of ordinary rabbit hair to replace angora produces threads of bad quality which spread everywhere: this is a fraudulent process which reflects badly on the angora industry.
Because of its softness angora hair is used for the manufacture of insulating underclothes (keratin). Ten percent angora in a mixture of wool, cotton and synthetic fibres makes an extemely soft fabric, very easy on the skin.
The kemp points and the covering hairs, which are more rigid rise from the fabric, giving it a fluffy appearance which is much prized. Whole angora hairs obtained by depilation are the most suited for this purpose.
Though the Angora rabbit exists in all colours, only the albino strain is produced now. Its coat is entirely white, which is an advantage for dyeing. The hairs are all modulated, which makes them lighter than wool (density 1.1 against 1.3) and increases their insulating properties. They have all the properties of keratin, notably insulation, water absorption and good dyeing quality.
The Angora rabbit's coat is 98.5 percent pure as cutaneous secretions (restricted to those of the sebaceous glands) are very slight and the animal grooms itself frequently (a sheep's fleece is 50 percent pure). Angora wool goes straight to the card without previous washing: it is imperative that the producer keep constant control over the cleanliness of the animals.
COMMERCIAL QUALITIES
There are several grades of hair, identified by length, type of animal and cleanliness. For first-quality hair 80 percent of the coat must be over 6 cm in length, and clean. This grade was worth US$50 a kg in 1981, but only $10 a kg in 1971. Second-quality hair is clean but too short (under 6 cm) or too woolly. It is grown on the belly and extremities, and is worth about 20 percent less than the first quality wool.
The hair of the young Angora is shorter and softer. It is the product of the first and sometimes the second collection. The clean but felled hairs collected on the necks of females or breeding animals are worth only 15 percent of the value of first quality hair.
Dirty hair of any length is virtually worthless. At best, it is worth less than shorn hair from ordinary rabbit breeds. Its value would be no more than 5-6 percent of the first quality. Clean hair is therefore absolutely essential in angora wool production.
RAISING ANGORA
RABBITS
Angora rabbits are reared primarily for their hair. The production of this hair calls for an entirely different set of techniques from those used in meat rabbit production. These techniques have reached the pinnacle of specialization in France, where the sole target is wool production.
The adult female produces the hair: adult, because top quality Angora is only produced from the third collection at 9 months, and female because the female produces more hair than the male-an average of 1 kg against 700-800 g for the male. So the hair-producing stock is made up of adult females that are maintained as long as possible, with reproduction kept at a minimum. Gestation and lactation reduce hair production by one third.
The number of breeding bucks is kept to a proportion of only 5 percent. In France the males not destined for breeding are culled at birth.
The hair is collected every 90-100 days, when the follicles reach the resting stage and before hair starts falling, which would cause felting and reduce the value. The hair is cut with scissors or electric or manual shears, or collected by depilation. The hair from each rabbit is sorted into its separate grades as soon as it is removed. The summer collection is smaller, up to a third less than that of autumn and winter. The spring collection is between the two.
Collection takes a skilled operator about half an hour per rabbit. Shearing is a little quicker than depilation, but the hair is of slightly poorer quality. In addition, with certain strains of Angora rabbits the hair grows back unevenly after shearing, while it is more regular after depilation.
The Angora rabbit is raised in an individual cage on straw litter for two reasons: to keep the hair clean and to avoid the formation of scabs on the paws, which eventually happens on mesh floors as Angora rabbits are heavy (4 kg) and their pads are unusually delicate. Damaged paws will cause production to drop by 25 percent compared to litter reared animals, and the rabbits may die. Raising the animals in cages, a feature of the extensive system, does not require costly investment and allows a gradual increase of production. One person working full time (2 400 working hours a year) can care for 500 rabbits-feeding, care, collection of wool, etc.
* Feeding and hygiene
Feeding Angora rabbits involves several peculiarities. Indeed the Angora at peak production is an adult rabbit from the physiological standpoint. Its growth is complete and reproduction is limited to a few animals. It must, however, produce over 2 kg of dry proteins a year- more than 1 kg of keratin (hair) and the same amount from the internal sheath of the hair follicle. This is the equivalent of 7 kg of muscle.
This explains the need for a high-protein diet-17 percent. The keratin in the hair is rich in sulphur amino acids, exporting 35 g of sulphur a year, so the proper intake of these amino acids (0.6 percent in the ration) must be ensured. French breeders give their animals top quality alfalfa hay supplemented by oats, which are preferred to other cereals. For a high production of hair 200 g of alfalfa hay and 100 g of oats are needed per rabbit per day. If the amount or quality of alfalfa hay is inadequate the diet should be supplemented by mixed concentrates, including feed cakes, dehydrated alfalfa meal, cereals, and vitamin, mineral and methionine supplements. Most Angora breeding units use this diet now. Some use solely the balanced pelleted feed designed for nursing does. In this case an average 170-180 g should be fed to each rabbit daily.
The Angora rabbit's feed requirements follow the cycle of collection (every 3 months) and hair regrowth. Requirements increase after depilation as the animal is then hairless and energy losses by radiation are very great. By the second month the animal is again well covered, but this is when the hair grows fastest so the ration must of course remain adequate. In the third month, requirements decrease because the hair grows more slowly and, as collection time approaches, starts to fall. Daily rations need to be adjusted carefully to these variable requirements.
It is now the practice to give 190-210 g per day of dry matter during the first month, 170-180 g during the second month and 140-150 g during the third month. If really necessary, in the 4 weeks after depilation a rabbit could be fed ad lib., but after this it must be rationed daily. It is also recommended that the rabbits not be fed 1 day a week so the stomach can empty, preventing or at least diminishing the risk of hair balls from self-grooming. The hair forms very hard balls (trichobezoars) which obstruct the pylorus and usually cause the animal's death.
The collection of the animals' hair poses problems of heat regulation for them. Just before collection the rabbit has an insulating mantle 6-10 cm thick, but after it is quite bare. The rabbits must therefore be kept at a temperature between 10 and 25°C (30°C at most). Most losses of adult Angoras occur during the days following hair collection as the animals then have problems maintaining thermal balance. They become particularly sensitive to respiratory germs (pasteurella, coryza, etc). The breeder must therefore be constantly on the alert regarding their general hygiene (frequent litter renewal, cleaning, disinfecting). Having to replace working females with young does lowers average production levels because first year Angora output is appreciably lower. Even more important, dirty hair is virtually worthless.
THE ANGORA IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES
A point to be considered very carefully is that Angora rabbit production is labour intensive and also requires great expertise. The slightest mistake can mean the loss of productive adults-the animals have to be over a year old to return a profit. Carelessness downgrades the product (dirty hair, bad cutting, felting, poor sorting).
Above all, not all climates are suitable: excessive heat and intense light (albinos) are very bad elements. In cold countries the solution is to use buildings that shelter the animals against the rigours of the winter. Housing should in any case provide Angoras with a clean, hygienic environment, and this is not possible everywhere. Feed is also costly, unless a producer is content to provide a meagre feed which will keep the animal alive but will halve hair production.
Angoras can be raised for both hair and meat. A considerable reduction in the hair yield will result. German breeders use this system, but production techniques are very strictly adhered to. Chinese breeders probably also produce Angora hair from dual-purpose animals slaughtered relatively young for meat.
A last point to remember, and probably the most important: Angora hair prices fluctuate according to fashion, with a cycle of 3 to 5 years. In 1971 many units disappeared in France because Angora hair dropped to US$10 a kg, compared with $20 in 1965 (it was $50 in 1981). The world market is so small that any considerable increase in output would cause a price slump.

9. Rabbit breeding and rural development
The mexican "family packages" programme
The DGAEM: an action agency
A development programme using rabbits
The objective of this chapter is to present a case study to show how rabbit production can help close the protein gap and raise the incomes of rural and suburban people in a great many countries. No attempt will be made to provide formulas for success-the various technical choices to be made will depend on the environment into which the rabbit is introduced. Instead the case history is used to uncover the questions that need to be asked in designing a programme like this and to determine the support structure needed for successful development in a traditional rural environment.
Generally speaking, the first task is to examine the external components of this kind of production system. There is an historical component, an environmental component, an animal component, a human component, and the socioeconomic components (agriculture and stock raising in the country, agrarian structure and industrial rabbit production). The interrelations among these various components should also be studied. They will reveal the advantages and constraints represented by rabbit production in reaching the objective: using local resources to supply animal proteins to rural families.
Next, the supporting structures and services available for development projects need to be investigated.
The mexican "family packages" programme
Mexico has been chosen for the case study analysis, because it is unquestionably the country which has approached the problem most fully and systematically.
The example used is the Paquetes familiares (family packages) programme developed in Mexico by the Dirección General de Avicultura y Especies Menores (DGAEM). This rural development activity uses several backyard animals, including rabbits. The aim is to develop the production of poultry (chickens, turkey, ducks), rabbits and bees, using local resources to produce quality animal proteins and honey, mainly for home consumption. The eventual marketing of products and byproducts will raise the income of the community.
Assisted by several rabbit production centres, the Mexican programme has a threefold mission:
* to inform producers, teach them all they need to know about rabbits, make them aware of the potential of rabbits, and draw the attention of the media to these actions;
* to train future breeders and experts/extension workers by teaching them the fundamental technical operations; and make it clear that rabbits are not reared the same way as chickens;
* to produce the breeding animals Mexico needs for both industrial and backyard rabbit production.
In support of this programme, DGAEM conducts a number of experiments at its centres to test production techniques, installations, equipment and feed formulas in local conditions. The production techniques developed in these centres are then introduced into the target rural communities.
HISTORICAL BACKGROUND
The wild rabbit found in Mexico belongs to the genus Silvilagus Gray. There are several species-Silvilagus andubonii, found throughout most of Mexico; Silvilagus brasilensis, in the southeastern part of the country; Silvilagus floridanus, in central Mexico; Silvilagus bachmani, in Lower California; and lastly the Zacatuche, in the volcanic zone.
The wealth of names reveals how important this animal was in the past. Among the Aztecs, Tochtli (rabbit) is the eighth of the 20 signs central to the Aztec calendar. This monumental stone is far more than a simple calendar. It is a compendium of their cosmological view of the world. Tochtli had relations with Xipetote, the goddess of agriculture and good harvests. He was also the symbol of fertility. In the cosmogony he descends from Mextli, who represented the moon. The peoples of Central America saw a rabbit in the dark parts of the sky around the moon. Ometochtli (two rabbits) is the god of "pulque", the god of intoxicating drinks.
Despite this sometimes alarming symbolism, Fray Bartolome de las Casas in his book Los Indios de México y Nueva España reports that pre-Colombian peoples used rabbit skins for clothing and appreciated how well they kept out the cold. Rabbit meat was also eaten. Cortez's soldiers saw rabbit meat in the great markets (the famous tianguis), especially in the Aztec capital. The Spaniards later imported domestic rabbits of the species Oryctolagus cuniculus (Linnaeus, 1758), for the backyards of their haciendas.
Eating habits have regressed. Nowadays rabbit meat is unknown to most Mexicans. The individual intake is less than 100 g per person per year. In 1975, of the 127 people's markets in the Federal District only 3 had stands offering rabbit for sale. It is found on some weekdays in some supermarkets. Consumption is therefore limited to a small fringe of the urban population, especially in the Mexico City area (often people of European origin). Most Mexican people have never tasted rabbit meat. Their unfamiliarity can make them suspicious, even hostile towards it.
THE ENVIRONMENT
Oryctolagus cuniculus is well adapted to the agroclimatic complex of its area of origin (the entire western Mediterranean). In the natural environment it encountered in Mexico some areas are more favourable than others. Mexico is a tropical country lying north and south of the Tropic of Cancer. Its relatively large size ( 1 970 000 sq km), impressive relief and mountain plateaus and the distance from north to south (about 2 000 km) explain the variety of climates and landscapes. The different combinations of latitude and altitude allow one to pass from a cool, temperate climate to a wet tropical one within a distance of a few hundred kilometres.
There are several large systems. In the centre a plateau area, the Altiplano, stands 1 000-2 500 m above sea level. The climate is pleasant and healthy. Temperatures range from 15 to 25°C, and the difference between day and night temperatures is considerable. A dry season alternates with a wet one of the same length. Northwards, the dry season lengthens. The plateaus change, sometimes into true desert (the Great Sonora, Lower California) and sometimes into great, closed depressions dotted by an occasional oasis. Towards the south the humid season is longer. The two mountain chains (the Sierra Madre) surrounding the plateaus converge to form a complex, low mountain system.
To the east the plateau slopes down to the Atlantic in a series of steps well watered by the humid winds, especially in the south. The further one goes the wetter it gets. The plains become semiaquatic in the state of Tabasco. The next region is Yucatan, a calcareous peninsula with shrubby vegetation.
The Pacific side to the west is a much steeper formation of crystalline rock Well watered to the south it is semidesert in the north.
In this mosaic of agroclimatic zones that make up Mexico the rabbit prefers the temperate or cool zones of medium rainfall-the high plateau and the Atlantic or Pacific slopes. As rabbits need a certain amount of water and forage their adaptation to the desert and semidesert zones would pose some problems. Rabbits also dislike heat more than cold. So the lowest, hottest areas have to be avoided.
However, trials in Colima, which has a hot, wet climate, show that the species has considerable potential for adaptation. Studies now underway should enable potential production areas to be better specified in the future, and possibly the selection of genetic types adapted to these tropical zones. These factors emphasize the importance of local genetic types where these exist.
While not every agroclimatic zone in Mexico is favourable for rabbits, some can be exploited in creative fashion. The "family packages" used by DGAEM in its programme usually contain the species or combination of species that will achieve the target objective. These associations (turkey-rabbit, chicken-duck or turkey-bee, etc) would be even more effective if reinforced with small ruminants such as goats or sheep or a monogastric species like the pig. There are one or more combinations of domestic animals for each agroclimatic zone, the goal being to make the rural community self-sufficient in animal proteins by making the most of the local natural resources.
THE ANIMAL COMPONENT
Worldwide, rabbit production is fairly extensive. Rabbits are found in almost every climate. The use of local breeds, where they exist, should be promoted. The direct introduction of selected animals into production systems should be discouraged. On the one hand these animals probably do not possess the characters of adaptation necessary, and on the other the strains almost all derive from just 2 breeds, the New Zealand White and the Californian. When imports are unavoidable, the rabbits should not be introduced directly into the rural environment, but rather studied for 1 or 2 generations in experimental stations where their reactions to their new environment can be observed.
THE HUMAN COMPONENT
The extraordinary population explosion in Mexico over the last few decades is both an advantage for the future and a terrible problem. The population was 13 million in 1900. It doubled in 50 years and stood at 26 million in 1950. Twenty-two years later it had again doubled. Today the 70 million mark has perhaps been passed and a figure of 120 million will doubtless be reached by the end of the century.
Demographic pressure is stronger in the rural areas. The outcome is a general rural exodus, amplified by a large emigration flow to the United States. Between 1960 and 1970 the active farm population shrank by 15 percent in relative terms. At the same time it also increased in absolute terms. The problem of undernourishment in these areas therefore continues to grow more acute.
SOCIOECONOMIC BACKGROUND
A look at Mexican agriculture is necessary to view the programme in the proper context, starting with an historical footnote on agrarian reform. A brief description of industrial rabbit production follows.
* Agrarian reform
Agrarian reform began about 1910 during the revolution, with the establishment of the ejidos (collective farms). Ejidos were either old rural communities whose former lands were restored to them, or haciendas (large estates dating from colonial times) confiscated and turned over to the farm labourers and tenant farmers working them and who run them as cooperatives. The process is not complete even today as there are still landless farmers in many areas. Of the arable lands 25 percent are still in the hands of landowners with over 1 000 ha. Despite the existence of laws protecting productive properties, the risk of expropriation holds investments to a very low level on these estates.
Each elide member also received a collection of plots, but these proved to be too small. The farmer can grow enough maize and beans to feed his family, but that is all. Only one of his sons can succeed him; the others have to go. Numerous efforts have been made by the government to finance the ejidos with nonagricultural capital but most of these have failed.
* Mexican agriculture
The traditional Mexican diet consists of tortillas (thin, flat, unleavened maize cakes), red beans and pimientos. Long a grain exporter, Mexico has become an importer in recent years. For example, maize exports had reached 1 million tonnes in the period 1965-69 and had dropped to nothing in 1975-79. Imports, however, totalled 1.5 million tonnes during this same period.

Pork 4.6 6.2

The consumption of animal products is growing, but there should be no illusions about the figures in Table 56. This increase is stronger in the cities and conceals the stagnation or even regression in meat consumption in rural areas. Between 1965 and 1976, agricultural output increased at half the rate of population growth. This is due in part to the existence of a vast sector that is underproductive: 3.5 percent of the land supplies 54 percent of all agricultural production, while at the other extreme 50 percent of the cultivated land supplies only 4 percent of total output. Despite this Mexico still has great reserves: 3.3 million hectares could be added to the 24 million hectares of agricultural land.
The government seems determined to develop this potential by the reasonable exploitation of its oil profits. It is aiming at national food self-sufficiency before the end of this decade, and the Sistema Alimentario Mexicano was launched for this purpose. This is an ambitious goal. Of the 70 million inhabitants, 19 million are suffering from malnutrition and 55 percent are not getting enough to eat. The unemployment figure due to this and to the population growth should be noted here. Underemployment is chronic in the countryside. The Mexican peasant works an average of 4 months a year. The rest of the time he cannot find any employment. Some try to improve their lot by doing several seasonal jobs.

* Industrial rabbit production
Industrial rabbit production differs from the rural variety mainly in its objectives, which are to reap a profit by producing animal proteins for urban markets.
In the early 1970s some people thought rabbits had a great role to play as suppliers of animal proteins for the steadily growing urban population swelled by the drift from the land. Entrepreneurs with capital to spare invested in rabbit production. They started by importing breeding animals and then marketed them. The market developed rapidly and many rabbitriess prang up.
At this point a number of negative factors began to emerge. The extremes of the climate had a depressing effect on intensive production. For better environmental control, costly buildings had to be constructed. Breeder expertise was scanty. There were grave problems with the feed used because of the poor quality of the raw materials and the small amounts manufactured. Growing production costs were concealed by the profits from the market for breeding animals. However, this market dried up in the end, so advertising campaigns were then mounted to stimulate the demand for rabbit meat.
Unfortunately there were no marketing structures. Supply and demand were never able to balance. The resulting instant overproduction caused a price slump. As production costs were high, many units closed down. Production dropped and demand was never met. The crisis dealt a lethal blow to the recently formed producers' organizations. They disappeared before they had had a chance to organize the market or reduce the number of negative factors.
Industrial production did not develop as had been confidently predicted in the early 1970s. Today the objective is different: to meet a social need by introducing a new product, rabbit, to top-ranking restaurants in a few tourist towns. The prices charged enable a small profit to be made despite production difficulties. This is still a very small market, however, and output is limited.
RABBIT PRODUCTION IN RURAL MEXICO
The first advantages of raising rabbits in small rural units are the intrinsic qualities of the species: its prolificacy, the quality of its meat and its faculty of adapting to varied environments. This last trait should be fully exploited in small units where mistakes will not entail the same drastic consequences as in large units with several hundred does.
The rabbit is a small animal. It requires few inputs (purchase of initial stock, buildings, etc) and it is the right size for home consumption. It can be reared by workers lacking great physical strength: women, children, old people. It therefore allows these categories to be part of the family labour force.
Fibrous feed is an important part of the rabbit's diet, so it does not compete directly with man for its food. This feature makes it highly complementary to other backyard animals (chickens, ducks, turkeys) or small ruminants (sheep, goats). It will make use of forages not otherwise used, kitchen and other wastes and so on. In addition to its meat it supplies certain byproducts such as skins and excrement which can be used. Processing the skins could provide a little employment for rural labour. Tourism should provide an outlet for these products. In the Mexican climate, earthworms can be used to convert manure into fertilizer. This is a fairly important resource in areas where chemical fertilizers are virtually unknown.
However, there are disadvantages. Despite their adaptability rabbits need a minimum of water and green or preserved forage, and do not support humid heat very well. Where rabbits are reared in cages their forage must be gathered and distributed. Rabbits cannot seek their own food like other domestic animals.
Rabbit is not a customary item in the Mexican diet. With some exceptions Mexicans are not acquainted with this meat and are often reluctant to try it.
Technical personnel trained in rabbit production are lacking. Even if the owner of a small unit can manage with labour that is not skilled, a certain minimum of technical operations need to be mastered. A rabbit is not reared like a chicken, so rural producers have to be trained. They also need to be assisted with the technical problems that can crop up periodically: health and reproduction problems, and so on.
To make good use of the advantages offered by the rabbit therefore requires a better knowledge of the animal: a knowledge of its requirements vis-a-vis the environment, a knowledge of rearing techniques, a knowledge of the products it supplies. It also needs motivated labour.
The DGAEM: an action agency
This agency has been working with rabbits since 1969. It also works with many other species: chickens, turkeys, ducks, geese, bees and pigs. The family packages programme was developed in cooperation with other development organizations. The rabbit component of the programme covers information, training in technical expertise and extension, the production of breeding animals and technical assistance to breeders. DGAEM has its headquarters in Mexico City and numerous production centres throughout the country. The Irapuato National
Rabbit Breeding Centre (State of Guanajuato) was set up in 1972. This is the only centre specializing in rabbit breeding; the other centres breed other animal species as well as rabbits.
At national level, information is prepared by a special department of the DGAEM. It issues brochures, reviews and other publications as well as audiovisual aids and any other appropriate teaching material to inform and interest farmers. It also assists other national and regional development agencies using the livestock species in which DGAEM specializes. It participates in agricultural and livestock fairs and keeps in contact with foreign agencies involved in the same work. A leaflet designed and drawn up by this department is published here to illustrate the work it does (Figure 44).
Promotion at the rural community level is the responsibility of a technician. Usually he works for another organization but has been trained in one of the DGAEM centres. This promoter is the key element in the field programme. His first step is to present the programme to municipal or ejido authorities. He explains clearly the origin, development and aims of the programme and the benefits it offers the population. He then organizes public meetings and visits families in the community. Next he hands out the information documents provided by DGAEM, trying to enlist the cooperation of local primary or vocational school teachers. Experience has shown that children are very good at persuading their parents to accept a family package.
The promoter makes a list of interested families and with them he examines how the family packages can be paid for. There are two ways of paying, in cash or in kind, with deferment for one year. For a package of 1 male and 5 does the farmer can pay back the same number of animals or 7 dried skins. A community representative collaborates with the promoter. He acts as his guide on visits to the production units.
In addition to their technical training these agents have been taught communication techniques. A few simple ideas help them in their work. Every message seeks to produce a change so its purpose must appear clearly. The manner in which the person receiving the message interprets it depends on his skill in communicating, his level of knowledge and sociocultural environment. So the information should be as accessible as possible to the person for whom it is intended. The one issuing the message should make his intentions stand out clearly. He also needs to choose the best medium for his message, from the leaflets, tapes, slides, films, posters, cinema and television available.
Feedback is not overlooked. Public reaction is important as it enables some details to be corrected and shows whether the objectives are being met. The number of families in a community who have asked for family packages is a good yardstick of success. The evaluation process continues throughout the programme.
FIGURE 44.-Sample of leaflet circulated in Mexico for the promotion of rabbit production
Training and extension in the family packages programme works on 2 levels: training the promoters who in turn train the producers.
Promoters are trained at the DGAEM centres in all livestock species handled by the programme. There are over 25 of these centres in the country. Courses are about 60 percent practice and 40 percent theory. The Irapuato course, for instance, lasts 3 weeks. This centre can take up to 50 students, including 30 boarders. The general course alternates with more specialized courses on production techniques and the use and tanning of skins. DGAEM also organizes regular seminars on rabbit production techniques for the public. For action to be as effective as possible, the following rules are followed:
* standardization of the content of the various courses taking place throughout the country;
* no direct training of schoolchildren and farmers but focus of efforts on the teacher or development agent acting in the community, making use of the snowball effect;
* the teachers taking these courses are kept informed on rabbit production progress in Mexico and abroad;
* the establishment of a documentation centre;
* the periodical updating of technical booklets so that new knowledge can spread as quickly as possible.
Farmers receiving the family packages are trained by the promoter. He is helped by the DGAEM, which supplies him with the necessary teaching materials. The promoter also offers direct assistance to families whenever the need arises. He must be particularly attentive to the crucial stages of the programme:
* construction of cages and shelters;
* arrival of animals;
* feeding;
* mating;
* birth and weaning of young rabbits;
* fattening and slaughter;
* consumption of meat by producer's family;
* utilization of byproducts.
Every month the promoter sends his comments to the DGAEM centre which supplied the animals. The centre can then help him if difficulties arise, such as a serious health problem. During the first year of operations an expert from the centre visits family package recipients once a month.
The production of breeding animals intended for the family packages programme is only one of the many functions of the DGAEM centres. DGAEM has set up a multilevel network. The Irapuato National Rabbit Centre has 1 500 breeding rabbits of various genetic types. It provides a certain number of lines to other DGAEM centres which breed them to supply the rabbits in their family packages. Irapuato also looks after the distribution of family packages in its own area.
This scheme has the merit of being simple and effective. The distribution centres can get by with small stocks of each genetic type. They can obtain fresh stud stock periodically from Irapuato. One day, artificial insemination may make it possible to avoid transporting breeding animals over long distances.
It might seem strange to breed all the basic stock in the same place, given the diversity of climatic areas. DGAEM is aware of this risk. However, the danger, if it exists, is serious only in the medium or long term. The various multiplication centres can test the reactions of the animals in their climatic environment and these animals could, if the need arose, constitute a core stock to begin setting up regional lines.
A centre the size of Irapuato has technical problems which are hard to overcome. Any country wishing to establish such a network should first acquire experience with medium size units before designing the central unit. Original solutions have enabled such problems to be very largely overcome in Mexico.
The Irapuato centre is first of all a production centre for breeding animals. It supplies purebred animals for other centres for multiplication, and pure or crossbred animals, as needed, for the family packages.
Irapuato is also an experimental centre. One of its tasks is to constitute Mexican rabbit lines. To do this it has had to identify the animals (tattoo breeding animals, tag animals temporarily at weaning), organize performance checks (record litter size at birth, at weaning and at 70 days, as well as individual weight at weaning, at 70 days and at first mating), and process and utilize all these data. Production quality is a constant concern of the people in charge of the centre.
Staff activities are programmed on a weekly basis: weaning on Mondays, selection of future breeding animals on Tuesdays, palpating on Wednesdays, etc. Certain operations are done every day (feeding. inspection of nests).
To facilitate the organization of the work each doe is assigned a card. A system of colour-coded clips and pigeonholes in which to place these cards makes possible the simultaneous management of all females at the same physiological stage. Each buck and litter also have cards listing their productivity in weight and numbers. These cards are not only useful for the immediate management of the animals, they also help to choose the breeding animals to be culled and the stock to be used for replacement.
Production evaluations are made monthly in each building in the centre. These data are processed in the centre and sent to DGAEM
headquarters in Mexico City. Each centre around the country sends in a monthly production balance sheet. The analysis of these monthly reports is extremely important for dealing with the technical problems arising in units of this size. Problems can be pinpointed rapidly, the causes analysed and attempts made to remedy them.
Irapuato is located on the Altiplano at 1 700 m above sea level. The altitude tempers the effects of the tropical climate. Temperatures are relatively high. Diurnal variations are considerable, from 16 to 30°C in summer and from 8 to 25°C in winter. The dry season, October to May, is about the same length as the wet season. Rainfall often takes the form of storms that cause major swings in humidity, which can shoot up from 40 to 95 percent. The buildings have been designed and improved to offset these climatic swings as much as possible.
A conventional pelleted feed is given to breeding and fattening animals. Its use has led to a better understanding of some of the shortcomings mentioned in the section on industrial rabbit production. This feed is brittle and tends to crumble. Its fibre and nitrogen contents are far too variable.
The causes of these defects are many: uneven quality of raw materials, small quantities produced, which stops the feedstuffs manufacturers from making needed investments, and so on. The problem of pelleted feed quality is one of the major barriers to technical success in large units such as the Irapuato centre. The animals could be fed green forage, but this solution has not been considered because it is labour intensive. There is also no guarantee of the quality and reliable supply of forage.
In units the size of Irapuato poor control of animal health would soon lead to catastrophe. With some exceptions individual treatment is seldom satisfactory in large-scale production, and is very costly. The answer is prevention, with the focus on the group, not the individual animal. Constant attention is therefore given to preventive hygiene:
* regular cleaning and disinfecting of equipment and buildings;
* daily removal of dead animals, quarantine of sick animals, rapid examination of breeding animals at each mating;
* avoiding stress and contamination of animals by personnel or inopportune visitors;
* control of other live vectors of contamination;
* regular analyses of feed composition and bacteriological quality of the water.
There are several genetic types of rabbit in Irapuato. Three are crossed to make up the family packages. These rabbits were imported during the 1970s and their performances are highly satisfactory. They have adapted well to local production conditions. Mass selection is practised. The least productive animals are culled and future breeding animals chosen from the litters of the best females.

In the New Zealand White and Chinchilla strains the standard criterion is the number of weaned rabbits per month of production. All the does in a building are entered on a double-entry worksheet (Figure 45). After each weaning the keeper changes the position of the doe on the card. Does on the left-hand side of the sheet are to be culled as soon as possible; those on the right-hand side will produce the young replacement females and on the far right the replacement males. Culling and selection will be determined on the average level of production, to keep a constant total in the herd. The offspring of does in the central section will be for distribution to other centres and for family packages. The Californian strain is selected in the same way. The main criterion is growth rate between weaning and 70 days.
Reproduction is not intensive (mating 17 days after kindling; weaning at 42 days). Various experiments at Irapuato have shown that this system gave the best compromise between quantity and quality under variable environmental conditions and where factors of production were not fully under control.
The organization of matings under one roof makes some selection possible while avoiding a too rapid increase in the average coefficient of inbreeding. To achieve these two conflicting goals each building is divided into breeding groups and matings are scheduled between these groups. This frees the keeper from having to check to see if the animals he is going to mate are related.
In the family packages a crossbred female is included, say a Chinchilla x New Zealand White genotype. She will be supplied to the producer with a Californian male (Figure 46). This cross offers the advantage of heterosis. With several genetic types, numerous combinations are possible. Some are now being evaluated at Irapuato and in the family packages programme. The multiplication centres do not keep much stock of each genetic type. They receive Chinchilla and Californian males regularly from Irapuato. Basically these centres multiply New Zealand White females.
FIGURE 46.-Example of crossbreeding based on 3 genetic types at Irapuato
Liaison with other development organizations is necessary because DGAEM cannot provide technical support for each family package distributed. The promoters and extension agents who are indispensable in linking DGAEM to the rural communities belong to other organizations for this reason.
A programme like family packages is just one component of an overall rural development strategy, itself a component of the national development plan. A global programme has to consider all the rural social questions of housing, health and hygiene, cultural activities and education. The promoter needs to integrate these components. To be effective, action must focus not at the family level but at the village community level. The fact that there are so many activities demands close coordination among the various bodies.
The promoter thus requires multiple training. In addition to strictly technical matters he must be conversant with other, nonagricultural fields such as hygiene and pollution control. Moreover, if he is to get his message across, he must have some rudiments of the social sciences.
DGAEM officials are well aware of these two essentials-coordination with other development organizations and technical training for promoters-but there are many problems that have not yet been solved in practice. The failure of the family packages programme in some communities was due to inadequate training for promotion and poor coordination with the DGAEM centre supplying the animals.
When the promoter has finished his publicity campaign he visits each interested family. He notes their resources and the time they have available. He then draws up the final list of applicants and sends it to the director of the nearest DGAEM centre.
Now it is time to start making the cages to house the rabbits. Each adult breeding animal must have its own. During the post-weaning fattening stage, however, several animals can occupy the same cage. So a group of 1 male and 5 females needs about 10 cages. The materials and techniques used vary according to what is available. The community's own resources will be utilized to the utmost.
Each cage has a drinker and feeder or feed rack. The nesting box is not always used when the floor of the cage is covered with straw litter, but is always recommended. In cold regions it is completely closed; in warmer areas it is left half open. In the hottest regions a simple wooden crate will suffice. It is provided with straw or wood shavings. To prevent the urine from collecting at the bottom several small holes are made in the floor of the nesting box.
Cages are always placed under some partial shelter from rain, wind, cold, direct sunshine and other extremes. The shelter should be designed and situated in consideration of the total microclimate, especially the direction of the prevailing winds. Where predators are a threat, adequate protection will be needed to keep them away from the cages.
When the cages are ready the promoter sets the arrival date for the animals with the DGAEM centre director. The animals are transported in a closed vehicle which protects them from sun and rain, in well-ventilated cages. They are given water every 8 hours.
The first few days are the tricky period of adaptation. The promoter pays careful attention to the rabbits' behaviour. Three hours after their arrival they are given fresh water. For the following 3 days they are given only dry feed. After that they may be given green forage.
For their feed the best use possible is made of local forage resources and kitchen waste, or feed wastes of other animals, so there is minimum competition with people for food. As part of the integrated rural development programme, families may be encouraged to plant kitchen gardens before the animals arrive. In some areas the promoter gives families kale seeds to plant. The aim is to find the cheapest feed while maintaining the animals at a certain production level. After a few weeks of adaptation, if the animals are over the age of 41/2 months they are gradually bred, presenting I female to the male each week.
Palpating is a delicate technical operation so it is seldom performed. Nesting boxes are systematically set up 25 days after mating. Ten days later, if the female has not kindled she is mated again. The rate of reproduction should be in keeping with available forage supplies. In some areas the females are not mated during the dry season.
Weaning takes place between 35 and 60 days. The aim is to obtain 4 litters per female a year, or 24 young, at an average rate of 6 per litter. The animals are slaughtered when they exceed a liveweight of 2-2.5 kg. However, the producer does not slaughter an animal until he wants it. Fattening animals constitute a live larder from which the producer takes what he needs when he needs it.
Healthwise, almost all treatments are discouraged. A few simple rules of preventive hygiene are usually enough:
* give varied feed daily;
* make structures which adequately protect the rabbits against the natural environment and predators;
* provide clean water;
* prevent the proliferation of flies and insects;
* regularly clean the installations;
* study the animals every day so as to detect quickly abnormal behaviour;
* quarantine sick animals;
* keep recently acquired animals in quarantine;
* keep visits to a minimum.
The promoter uses commercial products to treat benign infections such as ear canker or injuries to the foot pads. In more serious cases the animals are let out into a closed pen measuring a few square metres and provided with a rough shelter. This is the best and least costly way of looking after them. If this does not produce results the sick animals must be culled. When a serious health problem affects the community as a whole, the promoter calls in a DGAEM expert.
When it is time to slaughter and eat the first rabbits, the promoter's teaching role becomes critical. He has to teach the families to kill a rabbit cleanly, bleed it, cut it up and gut it. There is no better way than to give a demonstration right in the rabbitry. He shows them how to clean the carcass and set the skin out to dry so that it can be used later.
To induce the family-and especially the children-to eat the rabbit, just a little imagination and the slightest persuasion are usually all that is necessary: imagination to prepare the rabbit according to a local recipe; persuasion to get one member of the family to agree to take the first bite. At community level, a rabbit-tasting session could be arranged when the first young rabbits have reached slaughter age. DGAEM has published several booklets offering Mexican-style rabbit recipes.
There are many ways to use the byproducts, and the promoter will try to get the community to make the best and fullest use of them. Rabbit skins can provide the raw material for a small handcraft industry. Tanning will be done in a community workshop. DGAEM centres are equipped to teach these techniques. Many articles can be produced from the skins. The tanning workshop in the Irapuato centre, for example, makes bags, children's clothes and bed covers. Other parts of the rabbit can also be used, for example the paws and tails for keyrings.
The promoter ensures in advance that there are marketing outlets for these products, perhaps in one of the many tourist centres dotted about Mexico. Surplus meat can be sold to local restaurants. Earthworms can convert excrement into fertilizer where the climate is suitable, and this can be spread on the family's kitchen garden.
The promoter must carefully follow up the development of the programme in the community. After the various preparatory stages have been completed it is the production stage that convinces the producer of the programme's benefits. The number of kg of meat produced per family is an important standard. This is the point that will draw the interest of other families and nearby communities.
The next phase is home consumption-the number of kg of carcass eaten by the family, especially the children, should be the basic standard of evaluation. Income generated by the utilization of the byproducts and the sale of any surplus meat is also part of the development.
In supervising the programme the promoter notes the dates of his visits to each family, progress made in the unit and the advice he has given. He sums up the information on an evaluation form which he sends monthly to his DGAEM centre. On it he notes the output of the family packages, the side benefits and also the problems. This feedback is an essential part of the family packages programme, but in practice it is often difficult to obtain.

A development programme using rabbits
Analysing a small rural rabbitry depends on a number of interacting factors, not all operating on the same level. Figure 47 gives an idea of how they connect with each other. The reader can either start from the centre and read out, or start from the outside and read in. The objectives are in the centre. Here the major goal is to produce proteins to feed the breeder's family. A secondary goal is to generate family income through sales and employment.
The first circle around the centre shows the factors directly affecting achievement of the objectives. Double arrows show how several factors interact at the same level. The second circle contains a second series of factors. The plain arrows represent the action of one factor on another. The system considered here is only a sub-system, one component of a global system of rural development, and links with the outside are barely indicated in the diagram.
The programme is executed by a national organization. This structure is responsible for developing the work. Its task is to inform, create awareness, and provide training and evaluation. Local back-up is provided by regional units which do the same job. The regional units do not train the producers directly; they train the technical people who are in touch with the land. This decentralization is essential to the effectiveness of the whole and to avoid the excessive growth of the organization that is technically responsible for the programme.
The regional units produce and multiply the breeding animals. They may also act as centres for demonstration and experiment, where the animals' reactions to the production techniques and the agroclimatic conditions they will meet outside the centre can be tested.
This programme is one section of an integrated development programme. According to circumstances it might embody such features as production of other animal species, agronomy, horticulture, or perhaps home economics, hygiene or home renovations. Such integration requires good coordination between the executing agency and the other development agencies, some of which are technical while others are more concerned with socioeconomic work.
FIGURE 47.-Global analysis of a development programme using rabbits
In practice, liaison is through the promoter responsible for keeping the programme going. He will have been given basic training in rabbit production at one of the regional production centres. Preferably, he should have 2 years' experience in rearing rabbits. His training will also enable him to lead other programmes.
The sphere of action is the village community. To get these programmes off the ground at least 10 families have to join. This number makes the agent's work more effective, promotes interest in the community and makes mutual assistance more effective. It also makes it unnecessary to include 1 male in each batch of 5 females. The promoter can distribute a number of males among the units and organize their use.
The promoter must be in constant contact with the local branches of each organization involved in the programme. Periodic reports will enable him to evaluate his work. Regional experts can rapidly detect problems that come up and can help the promoter solve them. Feedback is essential for the system to run smoothly.
The human factor is a very basic component of this environment. The promoter has a primary role. It is he who arouses interest and enthusiasm, who provides information and who guides the rabbit keepers. He is both instructor and observer, he must not give up easily, but he must also be patient. He is largely responsible for the level of technical ability reached by the farmers.
It is hard to modify agroclimatic factors so they must be exploited as well as possible. An inventory of regional forage resources often requires the intervention of an agrobotanist. Medicinal plants could be useful, for example. Water resources will be the subject of a separate study.
There is a great deal of interaction at this level. The reproduction rate adopted must be decided on the basis of alternating seasons and thus according to forage resources. Where fodder is abundant the production potential of the species can be fully exploited. During harder times, most of the animals will be eaten by the producer's family. He will keep only the future breeding animals. This extreme pattern is adapted to regions where the dry season lasts less than 6 months. Microclimate, locally available materials and available labour will also determine the type of cage and shelter to be used.
The socioeconomic factors depend partly on other development programmes. It is these that determine any sales outlets for eventual meat surpluses or byproducts. Where there are enough byproducts a small industry can be launched to provide a little work and generate some income for the community.
The animal factor should not be overlooked. A systematic evaluation of local genetic types will help to breed animals adapted to the local agroclimatic complex. A policy of crossbreeding to reinforce this adaptation to the environment and so upgrade productivity can be tried. Selection should take place in an environment not too different from the area where the producers work. In countries with several clear climatic zones, selection should be done at the regional centres.
Rearing rabbits jointly with other animals such as domestic poultry, small ruminants or bees or fish is often the best way to exploit the resources available.
The production in large numbers of quality breeding animals is a difficult problem. One effective solution is to establish a network of multiplication centres based around one or more selection centres. Other solutions could be devised. But anything less than full control of such technical parameters as feed quality, or climatic parameters such as temperature, will lead to productivity problems. It is therefore wise to limit the size of these regional units to a few hundred females at the start.
Programme evaluation should not be limited to a simple quantitative analysis. The standard "amount of rabbit meat eaten monthly by each family member" is important, but it is far too restrictive. An attempt should be made to evaluate the social impact and profound transformations resulting from a programme like this. Evaluation, like the conception and follow-up of a programme, can only be carried out by a multidisciplinary team. This should include an agronomist, a livestock expert, a sociologist and an economist, at the very least.
